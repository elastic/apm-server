######################## APM Server Configuration Example #############################

############################# APM Server ######################################

apm-server:
  # Defines the host and port the server is listening on.  use "unix:/path/to.sock" to listen on a unix domain socket.
  #host: "localhost:8200"

  # Maximum permitted size in bytes of an unzipped request accepted by the server to be processed.
  #max_unzipped_size: 31457280
  # Maximum permitted size in bytes of a request's header accepted by the server to be processed.
  #max_header_size: 1048576

  # Maximum duration request will be queued before being read.

  # Maximum duration in seconds before releasing resources when shutting down the server.
  #shutdown_timeout: 5s

  # Maximum number of requests permitted to be sent to the server concurrently.
  #concurrent_requests: 5

  # Maximum number of new connections to accept simultaneously (0 means unlimited)
  # max_connections: 0

  # Authorization token to be checked. If a token is set here the agents must
  # send their token in the following format: Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.
  # It is recommended to use an authorization token in combination with SSL enabled.
  #secret_token:
  #ssl.enabled: false
  #ssl.certificate : "path/to/cert"
  #ssl.key : "path/to/private_key"

  # Please be aware that frontend support is an experimental feature at the moment!
  #frontend:
    # To enable experimental frontend support set this to true.
    #enabled: false

    # Rate limit per second and IP address for requests sent to the frontend endpoint.
    #rate_limit: 10

    # Comma separated list of permitted origins for frontend. User-agents will send
    # a origin header that will be validated against this list.
    # An origin is made of a protocol scheme, host and port, without the url path.
    # Allowed origins in this setting can have * to match anything (eg.: http://*.example.com)
    # If an item in the list is a single '*', everything will be allowed
    #allow_origins : ['*']

    # Regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame's `file_name` and `abs_path` attributes.
    # If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is considered to be a library frame.
    #library_pattern: "node_modules|bower_components|~"

    # Regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame's `file_name`.
    # If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is not used for calculating error groups.
    # The default pattern excludes stacktrace frames that have a filename starting with '/webpack'
    #exclude_from_grouping: "^/webpack"

    # If a source map has previously been uploaded, source mapping is automatically applied
    # to all error and transaction documents sent to the frontend endpoint.
    #source_mapping:

      # Source maps are are fetched from Elasticsearch and then kept in an in-memory cache for a certain time.
      # The `cache.expiration` determines how long a source map should be cached before fetching it again from Elasticsearch.
      # Note that values configured without a time unit will be interpreted as seconds.
      #cache:
        #expiration: 5m

      # Source maps are stored in a seperate index.
      # If the default index pattern for source maps at 'outputs.elasticsearch.indices'
      # is changed, a matching index pattern needs to be specified here.
      #index_pattern: "apm-*-sourcemap*"

  # If set to true, APM Server augments data received by the agent with the original IP of the backend server,
  # or the IP and User Agent of the real user (frontend requests). It defaults to true.

#================================ General ======================================

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')

  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # A value of 0 (the default) ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.

  # * `setup.template.name`
  # * `setup.template.pattern`
  # * `setup.dashboards.index`
  #
  #index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"

  # By specifying additional indices documents matching the criteria are indexed in a seperate index.
  # In case you are uploading source map documents (which is currently an experimental feature),
  # source map documents are going to their own index with the configuration below.
  #
  # Be aware that there is only one Elasticsearch template and one Kibana Index Pattern,
  # which needs to match against indices for ingested documents as well as for source maps.
  # In case you modify the index patterns you must ensure to use the same prefix for all indices,
  # and to accordingly set:
  # * `setup.template.name`
  # * `setup.template.pattern`
  # * `setup.dashboards.index`
