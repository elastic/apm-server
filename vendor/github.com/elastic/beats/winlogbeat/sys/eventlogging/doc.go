/*
Package eventlogging provides access to the Event Logging API that was designed
for applications that run on the Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, or Windows
2000 operating system.

It can be used on new versions of Windows (i.e. Windows Vista, Windows 7,
Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012), but the preferred API for those
systems is the Windows Event Log API. See the wineventlog package.
