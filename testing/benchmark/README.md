# Benchmark environment

**NOTE: This is unlikely to be useful for non-Elastic employees**

This folder contains the necessary scripts to create a customizable deployment
with APM Server and an AWS worker VM with `apmbench` uploaded with the necessary
credentials to run the benchmark against it.

## Dependencies

- `terraform`
- `curl`
- `ssh`
- `ssh-keygen`
- `scp`
- `jq`
- `go`
- `okta-awscli` (only for `all` and `auth` targets)
  - `python3`
  - `awscli`

## Credentials

To successfully use the this environment, you will need to have credentials for:

- An AWS account.
- ESS or self-serviced ECE environment API key (`EC_API_KEY` environment variable).

### AWS Credentials

In order to facilitate self-service of this environment without assuming the consumer
has the AWS credentials up to date, the `make all` (default target) and `make auth`
uses `okta-awscli` to generate the necessary credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`.
For more information on how to set up these, please refer to our [internal docs](https://github.com/elastic/observability-dev/blob/main/environments/ecetest/README.md#okta-aws-cli-setup).

It isn't a requirement to use `okta-awscli`, and your own credentials can be used
as long as they are provided in `~/.aws/credentials` under the `default` profile.

If you want to use a different profile, you can set the `AWS_PROFILE` make variable
to a different value.

### ESS Credentials

In order for the `ec_deployment` provider to work against ESS, it is necessary to provide
an API Key by exporting the environment variable `EC_API_KEY`. To generate a new API
key in ESS, you can navigate to [Features > API Keys > Generate API Key](https://cloud.elastic.co/deployment-features/keys).

## Usage

The `make` command is meant to be the main entrypoint to this environment, providing a light
layer of abstraction over terraform and other utility commands to facilitate the interaction.

Please ensure that you have both the ESS / ECE and AWS credentials. `make auth` will make sure
that you're authenticated with AWS, but ESS is left to configure on your own.

The main commands are:

- `all` (default): runs `auth`, `apmbench`, creates the config files and runs terraform apply.
- `auth`: Re-generate AWS credentials, they will expire after 4h.
- `run-benchmark-autotuned`: Run the benchmarks with a computed `BENCHMARK_AGENTS`.
- `run-benchmark`: Run the benchmarks, can configured by tweaking:
  - `BENCHMARK_WARMUP_TIME`: Set the amount of time to warm the APM Server for. Defaults to `5m`.
  - `BENCHMARK_AGENTS`: Set the number of agents to send data to the APM Server. Defaults to `64`.
  - `BENCHMARK_COUNT`: Set the number of times each benchmark scenario is run. Defaults to `3`.
  - `BENCHMARK_TIME`: Set the amount of time to run each benchmark scenario for. Defaults to `2m`.
  - `BENCHMARK_RUN`: Set the expression that matches the benchmark scenarios to run. Defaults to `Benchmark` (all).
  - `BENCHMARK_RESULT`: Set the output file where the results of the benchmark will be written. Defaults to `benchmark-result.txt`
  - `BENCHMARK_DETAILED`: Sets the `-detailed` when running `apmbench`, displaying extra metrics for each benchmark. Defaults to `false`.
- `index-benchmark-result`: Indexes `$(BENCHMARK_RESULT)` to an Elasticsearch cluster. Can be configured with:
  - `GOBENCH_INDEX`: Set the Elasticsearch index where the benchmark results will be stored. Defaults to `gobench`.
  - `GOBENCH_USERNAME`: Set the Elasticsearch username to use for authentication. Defaults to `admin`.
  - `GOBENCH_PASSWORD`: Set the Elasticsearch password to use for authentication. Defaults to `changeme`.
  - `GOBENCH_HOST`: Set the Elasticsearch host where the results will be indexed Defaults to `http://localhost:9200`.
  - `GOBENCH_TAGS`: Set additional tags to include in the Elasticsearch documents. No default.

Helper commands

- `~/.ssh/id_rsa_terraform`: Generates a new SSH key without passphrase for the worker VMs.
- `terraform.tfvars`:
    - Set `TFVARS_SOURCE` to use an explicit profile
    - Otherwise the `terraform.tfvars.example` file is used
    - Sets the `USER_NAME` var to `$USER`.
- `apmbench`: Compiles the `apmbench` binary from the provided location (`APMBENCH_PATH`).

### Override Docker Image

There are two ways to override the docker images (or tags) that Terraform will provision:

1. **Manual**: To use an already existing container, change the values of the `docker_image_override` (or `docker_image_tag_override`) field in the profile defined by `TFVARS_SOURCE` (default is `terraform.tfvars`).

2. **Automatic**: To encode local changes in `apm-server`, run `make docker-override-committed-version`.
    - This will build and push a new set of docker images to the internal docker registery.
    - If `IMAGE_TAG` is not set, the committed tags will be used as defined in `docker-compose.yml` in the repository root.
    - The file `docker_image.auto.tfvars` contains the Terraform variable overrides for the defined docker images. No need to override them manualy.
    - This file is not overridden automatically, you need to remove it manually if present.

### Set APM index shards

By default, the APM indices ship with `number_of_shards` set to `1`. To override this behavior, you can modify the `apm_shards` variable and individually set the setting for each of the component templates. See an example of how to do that in `terraform.tfvars.example`.

### Delete all the APM data streams

`make cleanup-elasticsearch` will delete all the APM data streams. This may be useful in case you'd like to re-run the benchmarks without destroying the deployment.

### Slack reporting

Reporting data is taken from the https://`<replace-with-kibana-benchmark-url>`/app/dashboards#/view/a5bc8390-2f8e-11ed-a369-052d8245fa04?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-30d,to:now))
It's possible to add or modify any metric.

Naming convention for metrics: `[metric_name]_(1w|2w|3w)`. The slack message contains an image and metric details (when CSV reporting is back in Kibana)
