Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main repo, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review.

Ensure your code follows the style guidelines of this project (run `make check-full` for static code checks and linting), and rebase your changes on top of the latest master branch.

Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken. See https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/master/TESTING.md for details.
