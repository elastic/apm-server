Hello!

We like to keep the Github repository for product issues - verified bug reports, pull requests, apm-server specific feature requests, etc and have users ask questions about how to use the product or a particular feature in our discuss forums.

If you have a question or are experiencing some problem please head on over to our official [Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm). You will reach a wider audience, get help from the broader community, and maybe learn how others solved problems similar to yours.


Thanks!
