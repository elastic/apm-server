  # A pipeline is a definition of processors applied to documents when writing them to Elasticsearch.
  # Using pipelines involves two steps:
  # (1) registering a pipeline
  # (2) applying a pipeline during data ingestion (see `output.elasticsearch.pipelines`)
  #
  # You can manually register pipelines, or use this configuration option to ensure
  # pipelines are loaded and registered at the configured Elasticsearch instances.
  # Automatic pipeline registration requires
  # * `output.elasticsearch` to be enabled and configured.
  # * having the required Elasticsearch Processor Plugins installed.
  #   APM Server default pipelines require you to have the `Ingest User Agent Plugin` installed.
  #   Find the default pipeline configuration at `ingest/pipeline/definition.json`.
  #
  #register.ingest.pipeline:
    # Registers pipeline definitions in Elasticsearch on APM Server startup. Defaults to false.
    #enabled: false

    # Overwrites existing pipeline definitions in Elasticsearch. Defaults to true.

#================================ General ======================================

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
#queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  #mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    #events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # The default value is set to 2048.
    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    #flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.
    #flush.timeout: 1s

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The
# default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
#max_procs:


#============================== Template =====================================

# A template is used to set the mapping in Elasticsearch
# By default template loading is enabled and the template is loaded.
# These settings can be adjusted to load your own template or overwrite existing ones.

# Set to false to disable template loading.
#setup.template.enabled: true

# Template name. By default the template name is "apm-%{[observer.version]}"
# The template name and pattern has to be set in case the elasticsearch index pattern is modified.
#setup.template.name: "apm-%{[observer.version]}"

# Template pattern. By default the template pattern is "apm-%{[observer.version]}-*" to apply to the default index settings.
# The first part is the version of apm-server and then -* is used to match all daily indices.
# The template name and pattern has to be set in case the elasticsearch index pattern is modified.
#setup.template.pattern: "apm-%{[observer.version]}-*"

# Path to fields.yml file to generate the template
#setup.template.fields: "${path.config}/fields.yml"

# Overwrite existing template
#setup.template.overwrite: false

# Elasticsearch template settings
#setup.template.settings:

  # A dictionary of settings to place into the settings.index dictionary
  # of the Elasticsearch template. For more details, please check

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using APM Server with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` option.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by apm-server.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------

  # By using the configuration below, apm documents are stored to separate indices,
  # depending on their `processor.event`:
  # - error
  # - transaction
  # - span
  # - sourcemap
  #
  # The indices are all prefixed with `apm-%{[observer.version]}`.
  # To allow managing indices based on their age, all indices (except for sourcemaps)
  # end with the information of the day they got indexed.
  # e.g. "apm-6.3.0-transaction-2018.03.20"
  #
  # Be aware that you can only specify one Elasticsearch template.
  # In case you modify the index patterns you must also update those configurations accordingly,
  # as they need to be aligned:
  # * `setup.template.name`
  # * `setup.template.pattern`
  #index: "apm-%{[observer.version]}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
  #indices:
  #  - index: "apm-%{[observer.version]}-sourcemap"

  # A pipeline is a definition of processors applied to documents when writing them to Elasticsearch.
  # APM Server comes with a default pipeline definition, located at `ingest/pipeline/definition.json`.

  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0600

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
#
# apm-server can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
#http.enabled: false

# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname or IP address. It is recommended to use only localhost.
#http.host: localhost

# Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
#http.port: 5066

#============================== X-pack Monitoring ===============================
# APM server can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires x-pack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Most settings from the Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that these settings should be configured to point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration. This means that if you have the Elasticsearch output configured,
# you can simply uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "apm_system"
  #password: ""

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200
  #hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Set gzip compression level.

  # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
  # dropped. The default is 3.

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
  # The default is 50.
  #bulk_max_size: 50

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to Elasticsearch
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, apm-server
  # tries to reconnect. If the attempt fails, the backoff timer is increased
  # exponentially up to backoff.max. After a successful connection, the backoff
  # timer is reset. The default is 1s.
  #backoff.init: 1s

  # The maximum number of seconds to wait before attempting to connect to
  # Elasticsearch after a network error. The default is 60s.
  #backoff.max: 60s

  # Configure HTTP request timeout before failing an request to Elasticsearch.
  #timeout: 90

  # Optional SSL configuration options. SSL is off by default, change the `protocol` option if you want to enable `https`.
  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
