# zPages

Enables an extension that serves zPages, an HTTP endpoint that provides live
data for debugging different components that were properly instrumented for such.
All core exporters and receivers provide some zPage instrumentation.

zPages are useful for in-process diagnostics without having to depend on any
backend to examine traces or metrics. 

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:55679): Specifies the HTTP endpoint that serves
zPages. Use localhost:<port> to make it available only locally, or ":<port>" to
make it available on all network interfaces.

Example:
```yaml
extensions:
  zpages:
```

The full list of settings exposed for this exporter are documented [here](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Exposed zPages routes

The collector exposes the following zPage routes:

### ServiceZ

ServiceZ gives an overview of the collector services by gives quick access to the
`pipelinez` and `extensionz` zPages.  The page also provides build and runtime 
information.

Example URL: http://localhost:55679/debug/servicez

### PipelineZ

PipelineZ brings insight on the running pipelines running in the collector. You can
find information on type, if data is mutated and the receivers, processors and exporters
that are used for each pipeline.

Example URL: http://localhost:55679/debug/pipelinez

### ExtensionZ

ExtensionZ shows the extensions that are active in the collector.

Example URL: http://localhost:55679/debug/extensionz

### TraceZ
The TraceZ route is available to examine and bucketize spans by latency buckets for 
example

(0us, 10us, 100us, 1ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1s, 10s, 1m]
They also allow you to quickly examine error samples

Example URL: http://localhost:55679/debug/tracez

### RpcZ
The Rpcz route is available to help examine statistics of remote procedure calls (RPCs) 
that are properly instrumented. For example when using gRPC

Example URL: http://localhost:55679/debug/rpcz
