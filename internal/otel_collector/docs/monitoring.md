# Monitoring

Many metrics are provided by the Collector for its monitoring. Below some
key recommendations for alerting and monitoring are listed. All metrics
referenced below are using the `--new-metrics` option that is enabled by
default.

## Critical Monitoring

### Data Loss

Use rate of `otelcol_processor_dropped_spans > 0` and
`otelcol_processor_dropped_metric_points > 0` to detect data loss, depending on
the requirements set up a minimal time window before alerting, avoiding
notifications for small losses that are not considered outages or within the
desired reliability level.

### Low on CPU Resources

This depends on the CPU metrics available on the deployment, eg.:
`kube_pod_container_resource_limits_cpu_cores` for Kubernetes. Let's call it
`available_cores` below. The idea here is to have an upper bound of the number
of available cores, and the maximum expected ingestion rate considered safe,
let's call it `safe_rate`, per core. This should trigger increase of resources/
instances (or raise an alert as appropriate) whenever 
`(actual_rate/available_cores) < safe_rate`.

The `safe_rate` depends on the specific configuration being used.
// TODO: Provide reference `safe_rate` for a few selected configurations.

## Secondary Monitoring

### Queue Length

The `queued_retry` processor is recommended as the retry mechanism for the
Collector and as such should be used in any production deployment.
The `queued_retry` processor provides the
`otelcol_processor_queued_retry_queue_length` metric, besides others.
When this metric is growing constantly it is an indication that the Collector
is not able to send data as fast as it is receiving.
This will precede data loss and also can indicate a Collector low on resources.

### Receive Failures

Sustained rates of `otelcol_receiver_refused_spans` and
`otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points` indicate too many errors returned to
clients. Depending on the deployment and the clientâ€™s resilience this may
indicate data loss at the clients.

Sustained rates of `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans` and
`otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points` indicate that the Collector is not
able to export data as expected.
It doesn't imply data loss per se since there could be retries but a high rate
of failures could indicate issues with the network or backend receiving the
data.

## Data Flow

### Data Ingress

The `otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans` and
`otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points` metrics provide information about
the data ingested by the Collector.

### Data Egress

The `otecol_exporter_sent_spans` and
`otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points`metrics provide information about
the data exported by the Collector.
