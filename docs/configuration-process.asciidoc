[[configuration-apm-server]]
=== Configuration options: `apm-server.*`

[[host]]
[float]
==== `host`
Defines the host and port the server is listening on.
Use "unix:/path/to.sock" to listen on a unix domain socket.
Defaults to 'localhost:8200'.

[[max_header_size]]
[float]
==== `max_header_size`
Maximum permitted size of a request's header accepted by the server to be processed (in Bytes).
Defaults to 1048576 Bytes (1 MB).

[[read_timeout]]
[float]
==== `read_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for reading an entire request.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[write_timeout]]
[float]
==== `write_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for writing a response.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[shutdown_timeout]]
[float]
==== `shutdown_timeout`
Maximum duration in seconds before releasing resources when shutting down the server.
Defaults to 5 seconds.

[float]
[[configuration-v1-api]]
=== Configuration options: v1 Intake API deprecated[6.5]

Version 6.5 of the APM Server introduced a new intake API. You can learn more about this change in the <<intake-api-changes-65, intake API changes>> documentation. 

If you do not upgrade your APM Agent, you'll continue to use the deprecated v1 intake API endpoint, and thus, the following configuration options.

[[max_unzipped_size]]
[float]
==== `max_unzipped_size` deprecated[6.5]
Maximum permitted size of an unzipped request accepted by the server to be processed (in Bytes).
Defaults to 31457280 Bytes (30 MB).

[[max_request_queue_time]]
[float]
==== `max_request_queue_time` deprecated[6.5]
Maximum duration a request will be queued before being read.
Defaults to 2 seconds.

[[concurrent_requests]]
[float]
==== `concurrent_request` deprecated[6.5]
Maximum number of requests the server can process concurrently.
Read more about how to tune data ingestion by <<adjust-concurrent-requests, adjusting concurrent_requests>>.
Default value is 5.

[float]
[[configuration-v2-api]]
=== Configuration options: v2 Intake API

Version 6.5 of the APM Server introduced a new intake API. You can learn more about this change in the <<intake-api-changes-65, intake API changes>> documentation. 

The following configuration options only affect users that have upgraded their agent to take advantage of the new v2 intake API. 

[[max_event_size]]
[float]
==== `max_event_size`
Maximum permitted size of an event accepted by the server to be processed (in Bytes).
Defaults to 307200 Bytes.

[float]
[[configuration-other]]
=== Configuration options: general

[[max_connections]]
[float]
==== `max_connections`
Maximum number of TCP connections to accept simultaneously.
Default value is 0, which means _unlimited_.

[[config-secret-token]]
[float]
==== `secret_token`
Authorization token for sending data to the APM server.
If a token is set, the agents must send it in the following format:
Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.
The token is not used for RUM endpoints. By default, no authorization token is set.

It is recommended to use an authorization token in combination with SSL enabled.
Read more about <<securing-apm-server, Securing APM Server>> and the <<secret-token, secret token>>.

[[capture_personal_data]]
[float]
==== `capture_personal_data`
If true,
APM Server captures the IP of the instrumented service and its User Agent if any.
Enabled by default.

[[expvar.enabled]]
[float]
==== `expvar.enabled`
When set to true APM Server exposes https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/[golang expvar].
Disabled by default.

[[expvar.url]]
[float]
==== `expvar.url`
Configure the url to expose expvar.
Defaults to `debug/vars`.

[[instrumentation.enabled]]

Enabled by default.

[[register.ingest.pipeline.enabled]]
[float]
==== `register.ingest.pipeline.enabled`
Loads pipeline definitions to Elasticsearch on APM Server startup.
Defaults to false.

[[register.ingest.pipeline.overwrite]]
[float]
==== `register.ingest.pipeline.overwrite`
Overwrites existing pipeline definitions in Elasticsearch. Defaults to true.

[float]
=== Configuration options: `queue.mem.*`
Data is buffered in a memory queue before it is published to the configured output.
`queue.mem.*` settings modify the queue behavior.

[[mem.events]]
[float]
==== `events`
Maximum number of events the memory queue can buffer.
Read more about how this setting can be used for <<tune-data-ingestion, tuning data ingestion>>.
Default value is 4096.

[[mem.flush.min_events]]
[float]
==== `flush.min_events`
Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
A value of 0 (the default) ensures events are immediately available to be sent to the outputs.

[[mem.flush.timeout]]
[float]
==== `flush.timeout`
Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
if the number of events stored in the queue is < _min_flush_events_.
Default value is 1 second.

[float]
=== Configuration options: `max_procs`

[[max_procs]]
[float]
==== `max_procs`
