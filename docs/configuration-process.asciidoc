[float]
=== Configuration options `apm-server.*`

[[host]]
[float]
==== `host`
Defines the host and port the server is listening on.
Use "unix:/path/to.sock" to listen on a unix domain socket.
Defaults to 'localhost:8200'.

[[max_unzipped_size]]
[float]
==== `max_unzipped_size`
Maximum permitted size of an unzipped request accepted by the server to be processed (in Bytes).
Defaults to 31457280 Bytes (30 MB).

[[max_header_size]]
[float]
==== `max_header_size`
Maximum permitted size of a request's header accepted by the server to be processed (in Bytes).
Defaults to 1048576 Bytes (1 MB).

[[max_request_queue_time]]
[float]
==== `max_request_queue_time`
Maximum duration a request will be queued before being read.
Defaults to 2 seconds.

[[read_timeout]]
[float]
==== `read_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for reading an entire request.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[write_timeout]]
[float]
==== `write_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for writing a response.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[shutdown_timeout]]
[float]
==== `shutdown_timeout`
Maximum duration in seconds before releasing resources when shutting down the server.
Defaults to 5 seconds.

[[concurrent_requests]]
[float]
==== `concurrent_request`
Maximum number of requests the server can process concurrently.
Read more about how to tune data ingestion by <<adjust-concurrent-requests, adjusting concurrent_requests>>.
Default value is 5.

[[max_connections]]
[float]
==== `max_connections`
Maximum number of TCP connections to accept simultaneously.
Default value is 0, which means _unlimited_.

[[instrumentation.enabled]]
[float]
==== `instrumentation.enabled`
Enables self instrumentation of the APM Server itself.
Disabled by default.

[[config-secret-token]]
[float]
==== `secret_token`
Authorization token for sending data to the APM server.
If a token is set, the agents must send it in the following format:
Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.
The token is not used for RUM endpoints. By default no authorization token is set.

It is recommended to use an authorization token in combination with SSL enabled.
Read more about <<securing-apm-server, Securing APM Server>> and the <<secret-token, secret token>>.

[[capture_personal_data]]
[float]
==== `capture_personal_data`
If true,
APM Server captures the IP of the instrumented service and its User Agent if any.
Enabled by default.

[[expvar.enabled]]
[float]
==== `expvar.enabled`
When set to true APM Server exposes https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/[golang expvar].
Disabled by default.

[[expvar.url]]
[float]
==== `expvar.url`
Configure the url to expose expvar.
Defaults to `debug/vars`.

[[metrics.enabled]]
[float]
==== `metrics`
Experimental Metrics endpoint for collecting application metrics.
Enabled by default.

[float]
=== Configuration options `queue.mem.*`
Data is buffered in a memory queue before it is published to the configured output.
`queue.mem.*` settings modify the queue behaviour.

[[mem.events]]
[float]
==== `events`
Maximum number of events the memory queue can buffer.
Read more about how this setting can be used for <<tune-data-ingestion, tuning data ingestion>>.
Default value is 4096.

[[mem.flush.min_events]]
[float]
==== `flush.min_events`
Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
A value of 0 (the default) ensures events are immediately available to be sent to the outputs.

[[mem.flush.timeout]]
[float]
==== `flush.timeout`
Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
if the number of events stored in the queue is < _min_flush_events_.
Default value is 1 second.

[float]
=== Configuration options `max_procs`

[[max_procs]]
[float]
==== `max_procs`
Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously.
The default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.
