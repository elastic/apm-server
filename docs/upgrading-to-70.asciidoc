in the APM Server and the APM UI that you should be aware of.

==== Upgrade Steps

Check the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility[Product Compatibility matrix]
to determine if you need to upgrade Elasticsearch and Kibana. 

. Upgrade {ref}/setup-upgrade.html[Elasticsearch].
. Upgrade {kibana-ref}/upgrade.html[Kibana].
. Ensure all of your APM agents are upgraded to a version that supports APM Server >= 6.5.
The {apm-overview-ref-v}/agent-server-compatibility.html[agent/server compatibility matrix]
will help determine compatibility.
. Upgrade APM Server (see below if upgrading from an RPM or Deb install).
. Use the Kibana migration assistant, found in the Kibana Management tab,
to migrate 6.x data to the 7.x format. 

===== Upgrading from 6.x RPM or Deb install

When upgrading from an RPM or Deb install,
you'll be prompted with a warning saying the install is going to overwrite `/etc/apm-server/apm-server.yml`.
Here's what you should do:

. Back up your current `apm-server.yml` configuration file.
. Accept the "overwrite" option from the `7.0` install.
. Copy/Paste any configuration options you want to keep from the old config file to the new config file.
