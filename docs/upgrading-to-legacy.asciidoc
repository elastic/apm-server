// [[upgrade-to-legacy-apm]]
// === Upgrade to legacy versions of Elastic APM

// We recommend upgrading to version 7.17 prior to upgrading to version 8.x.
// Make sure to review the 7.x {apm-guide-7x}/release-notes.html[release notes]
// and {apm-guide-7x}/apm-breaking.html[breaking changes] for important changes between
// your current APM version and the one you are upgrading to.

// In addition, there are upgrade guides available for certain minor versions:

// * <<upgrading-to-80,Upgrade to version 8.0>>
// * {apm-guide-7x}/upgrading-to-717.html[Upgrade to version 7.17]
// * {apm-guide-7x}/upgrading-to-77.html[Upgrade to version 7.7]
// * {apm-guide-7x}/upgrading-to-70.html[Upgrade to version 7.0]





// . Review the APM <<release-notes,release notes>>, <<apm-breaking,breaking changes>>,
// and Observability {observability-guide}/whats-new.html[What's new] content

// . The Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana) must be upgraded before APM Server.
// See the {stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Elastic Stack Installation and Upgrade Guide] for guidance.



// . Install the new APM Server release.

// . Review the `apm-server.yml` configuration file.
// There may be newly added configuration options, and you'll want to be aware of their default settings.
// See <<configuring-howto-apm-server,configuring>> for more information on available options.

// . If you set up index patterns and dashboards manually by running `./apm-server setup`,
// rerun the command to update the index pattern and the dashboards.

// . Start the APM server.
// +
// When you start the APM server after upgrading, it creates new indices that use the current version,
// and applies the correct template automatically.
