== Sourcemap Upload API

The APM Server exposes an API endpoint to upload source maps for <<rum, real user monitoring (RUM)>>.

[[sourcemap-endpoint]]

=== Upload endpoint
Send a `HTTP POST` request with the `Content-Type` header set to `multipart/form-data` to the source map endpoint:

[source,bash]
------------------------------------------------------------
http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/assets/v1/sourcemaps
------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The URL for uploading sourcemaps was previously `/v1/sourcemaps`. It still works, but is being deprecated in favor of `/assets/v1/sourcemaps`.

[[sourcemap-request-fields]]

==== Request Fields
The request must include some fields needed to identify `source map` correctly later on:

* `service_name`
* `service_version`
* `bundle_filepath`: needs to be the absolute path of the final bundle as it is used in the web application

The source map must follow the
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k[Source map revision 3 proposal] spec and be attached as a `file upload`.

You can configure a <<secret-token, secret token>> to upload sourcemaps.
