== Source map upload API

IMPORTANT: You must <<configuration-rum,enable RUM support>> in the APM Server for this endpoint to work.

The APM Server exposes an API endpoint to upload source maps for real user monitoring (RUM).
See the <<sourcemaps,create and upload source maps>> guide to get started.

[[sourcemap-endpoint]]
[float]
=== Upload endpoint
Send a `HTTP POST` request with the `Content-Type` header set to `multipart/form-data` to the source map endpoint:

[source,bash]
------------------------------------------------------------
http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/assets/v1/sourcemaps
------------------------------------------------------------

[[sourcemap-request-fields]]
[float]
==== Request Fields
The request must include some fields needed to identify `source map` correctly later on:

* `service_name`
* `service_version`
* `sourcemap` - must follow the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k[Source map revision 3 proposal]
spec and be attached as a `file upload`.
* `bundle_filepath` - the absolute path of the final bundle as it is used in the web application

You can configure an <<api-key,API key>> or <<secret-token,secret token>> to restrict sourcemap uploads.

[[sourcemap-apply]]
==== How source maps are applied

APM Server attempts to find the correct source map for each `stack trace frame` in an event.
To do this, it tries the following:

* Compare the event's `service.name` with the source map's `service_name`
* Compare the event's `service.version` with the source map's `service_version`
* Compare the stack trace frame's `abs_path` with the source map's `bundle_filepath`

If a source map is found, the `stack trace frame` attributes `filename`, `function`, `line number`, and `column number` are overwritten,
and `abs path` is https://golang.org/pkg/path/#Clean[cleaned] to be the shortest path name equivalent to the given path name.
If multiple source maps are found,
the one with the latest upload timestamp is used.

==== Example

Example source map request including an optional <<secret-token, secret token>> "mysecret":

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8200/assets/v1/sourcemaps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret" \
  -F service_name="test-service" \
  -F service_version="1.0" \
  -F bundle_filepath="http://localhost/static/js/bundle.js" \
  -F sourcemap=@bundle.js.map
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
