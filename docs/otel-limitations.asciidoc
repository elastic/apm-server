=== Limitations

[float]
[[open-telemetry-traces-limitations]]
==== OpenTelemetry traces

* Traces of applications using `messaging` semantics might be wrongly displayed as `transactions` in the APM UI, while they should be considered `spans` (see issue https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/7001[#7001]).
* Inability to see Stack traces in spans.
* Inability in APM views to view the "Time Spent by Span Type"  (see issue https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/5747[#5747]).

[float]
[[open-telemetry-metrics-limitations]]
==== OpenTelemetry metrics

* Inability to see host metrics in Elastic Metrics Infrastructure view when using the OpenTelemetry Collector host metrics receiver (see issue https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/5310[#5310]).

[float]
[[open-telemetry-logs-intake]]
==== OpenTelemetry logs

* preview:[] The OpenTelemetry logs intake via APM Server is in technical preview.
* The application logs data stream (`app_logs`) has dynamic mapping disabled. This means the automatic detection and mapping of new fields is disabled (see issue https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/9093[#9093]).

[float]
[[open-telemetry-otlp-limitations]]
==== OpenTelemetry Line Protocol (OTLP)

APM Server supports both the {ot-grpc}[(OTLP/gRPC)] and {ot-http}[(OTLP/HTTP)] protocol with ProtoBuf payload.
APM Server does not yet support JSON Encoding for OTLP/HTTP.

[[open-telemetry-collector-exporter]]
==== OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic

The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticexporter#legacy-opentelemetry-collector-exporter-for-elastic[OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic]
was deprecated in 7.13 and replaced by the native support of the OpenTelemetry Line Protocol in
Elastic {observability} (OTLP). To learn more, see
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticexporter#migration[migration].
