=== Configuring Index Pattern

The same APM Server process can handle data from multiple services.
If you want to send data from each service to separate indices,
you can include the service name in the Elasticsearch index pattern in the following manner:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  index: "apm-%{[context.service.name]}-%{[beat.version]}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
----

This will have the effect that all events end up in service-specific indices,
and it will enable you to set security restrictions based on your index pattern.

NOTE: Changing the default index pattern will break the Kibana UI and dashboards.
We intend to add support for custom index patterns in future versions of the Kibana UI.
