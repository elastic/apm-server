== Upgrading APM Server

We do our best to keep APM Server backward compatible between minor releases.
However, check out the <<breaking-changes, breaking changes>> section for exceptions.

Before upgrading:

* Review the <<release-notes,release notes>> and the <<breaking-changes, breaking changes>> 
for changes between your current version and the one you are upgrading to.
* Check the {stack-ref}/index.html[Elastic Stack Installation and Upgrade Guide] for guidance on how to upgrade your 
 Elastic Stack. 
 For a more tailored upgrade guide, try out the {upgrade_guide}[Interactive Upgrade Guide].

When ready to actually upgrade your APM Server between minor versions, 
simply install the new release.

Ensure the configuration file `apm-server.yml` is configured properly again according to your needs.
Be aware of newly added configuration options and their default settings.
Also check out the documentation for <<configuring-howto-apm-server, configuration>>
to read more about available configuration options.

If you set up index patterns and dashboards manually by running `./apm-server setup`, rerun
the command to update the index pattern and the dashboards.

When everything is properly configured and updated, start the APM server.

When you start the APM server after upgrading, it creates new indices that use the current version,
and applies the correct template automatically.
