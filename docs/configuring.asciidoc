== SSL/TLS settings

SSL/TLS is available for:

* <<agent-server-ssl,APM Server **inputs**>> (APM Agents)
* <<configuration-ssl,APM Server **outputs**>> that support SSL, like {es}, {ls}, or Kafka.

Additional information on getting started with SSL/TLS is available in <<securing-apm-server>>.

// The leveloffset attribute pushes all headings in the included document down by
// the specified number of levels. It is required here because the shared Beats
// documentation was created as a level 1 heading. In the APM book, this level
// would break the DTD. Using leveloffset +1, we can include this file here.
// It's important too reset the level heading after including the file.
