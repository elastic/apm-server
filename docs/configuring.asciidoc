== Configuring and running APM Server 

In a production environment,
you would put APM Server on its own machines,
similar to how you run Elasticsearch.
You _can_ run it on the same machines as Elasticsearch,
but this is not recommended,
as the processes will be competing for resources.

To start APM Server, run:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
./apm-server -e
----------------------------------

You should see APM Server start up.
It will try to connect to Elasticsearch on localhost port 9200 and expose an API to agents on port 8200.
You can change the defaults by supplying a different address on the command line:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
./apm-server -e -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=ElasticsearchAddress:9200 -E apm-server.host=localhost:8200
----------------------------------

Or you can update the `apm-server.yml` configuration file to change the defaults.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
apm-server:
  host: localhost:8200

output:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ElasticsearchAddress:9200
----------------------------------


NOTE: If you are using an X-Pack secured version of Elastic Stack,
you need to specify credentials in the config file before you run the commands that set up and start APM Server.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["ElasticsearchAddress:9200"]
  username: "elastic"
  password: "elastic"
----

See https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/blob/{doc-branch}/apm-server.reference.yml[`apm-server.reference.yml`] for more configuration options.
