== Configure Index lifecycle management (ILM)

++++
<titleabbrev>Index lifecycle management</titleabbrev>
++++

The {ref}/getting-started-index-lifecycle-management.html[index lifecycle management] (ILM)
feature in {es} allows you to automate the lifecycle of your APM Server indices as they grow and age.

IMPORTANT: ILM policies are only applied to indices created after the policies have taken effect.
In other words, any indices present before ILM was configured still need to be managed manually.

To learn how to define your own index lifecycle policies, see <<ilm,customize index lifecycle management>>.

[[ilm-default]]
=== Default policy

ILM is enabled by default, and the default policy
will be applied to all APM indices as long as all of the following conditions are true:

* The Elasticsearch instance supports ILM.
* `output.elasticsearch` is enabled.
* Custom `index` or `indices` settings are not configured.

The default ILM policy applies *hot* and *warm* phases to all APM events:
`span`, `transaction`, `error`, and `metric`.
*Cold* and *delete* phases are not defined.

* *Hot* -- Rollover data when the index reaches a maximum size of 50gb or a maximum age of 30 days:
`max_size: 50gb`, `max_age: 30d`

* *Warm* -- Move to warm phase after 30 days: `min_age: 30d`

[[ilm-config-scenarios]]
=== Configuration scenarios

The following table can help you determine which options to configure when enabling,
setting up, or disabling ILM:

|=======================================================================
2+|*Enable ILM and Enable ILM setup.*
|_Details:_
Create managed indices. Default policies and templates are written to Elasticsearch.

_Successful if:_ A policy and template do not exist.

_Example:_ Starting APM Server for the first time.

|_Configure these options:_

  <<ilm-enabled-config,`ilm.enabled:true`>>
  <<ilm-setup-config,`ilm.setup.enabled:true`>>

|_Details:_
Create managed indices. Customized policies and templates are written to Elasticsearch.

_Successful if:_ A policy and template already exists.

_Example:_ You’re customizing a policy that’s already been sent to Elasticsearch.

|_Configure these options:_

  <<ilm-enabled-config,`ilm.enabled:true`>>
  <<ilm-setup-config,`ilm.setup.enabled:true`>>
  <<ilm-setup-overwrite-config,`ilm.setup.overwrite:true`>>

2+|*Disable ILM and Enable ILM setup.*

|_Details:_
Create unmanaged indices. Ensure event specific templates are set up accordingly.

|_Configure these options:_

  <<ilm-enabled-config,`ilm.enabled:false`>>
  <<ilm-setup-config,`ilm.setup.enabled:true`>>
  <<ilm-setup-overwrite-config,`ilm.setup.overwrite:true`>>

2+|*Enable ILM and Disable ILM setup.*

|_Details:_
Use managed indices. No policies and templates will be created by APM Server.

_Example:_ You're creating your policies and templates elsewhere, e.g., with Elasticsearch APIs.

|_Configure these options:_

  <<ilm-enabled-config,`ilm.enabled:true`>>
  <<ilm-setup-config,`ilm.setup.enabled:false`>>

2+|*Use custom Indices*

|_Details:_
Configure event specific templates when using custom index names.

|_Configure these options:_

  <<ilm-enabled-config,`ilm.enabled:auto`>>
  <<ilm-setup-overwrite-config,`ilm.setup.overwrite:true`>>
  `output.elasticsearch.index: "my-custom-index"`
|=======================================================================

[float]
[[ilm-config-reference]]
=== Configuration reference

[float]
[[ilm-enabled-config]]
===== `ilm.enabled`

Can be `"auto"`, `"true"`, or `"false"`. Defaults to `"auto"`.

*`"auto"`*:
APM Server will enable ILM only if all three of the conditions below are true.
If any of the conditions are not met, ILM will be disabled.

** The Elasticsearch instance supports ILM.
** `output.elasticsearch` is enabled.
** Custom `index` or `indices` settings are not configured.

*`"true"`*:
APM Server will ignore any configured index settings and enable ILM if both of the conditions below are true.
If any of the conditions are not met, APM Server will disable ILM, create unmanaged indices, and an error will be logged.

** `output.elasticsearch` is enabled.
** The Elasticsearch instance supports ILM.

*`"false"`*:
Explicitly disables ILM.

[float]
[[ilm-setup-config]]
===== `apm-server.ilm.setup.enabled`

Defaults to `true`.

When `true`, APM Server will create an ILM specific index template for each APM event type.
This is required to map ILM aliases and policies to indices.

When `false`, ILM setup is disabled. No policies, templates, or aliases will be created by APM Server.
Only disable `ilm.setup` if you want to set up index management on your own.
If you simply want to disable ILM, use `apm-server.ilm.enabled: false` instead.

[float]
[[ilm-setup-overwrite-config]]
===== `apm-server.ilm.setup.overwrite`

Defaults to `false`. When `false`, APM Server will not overwrite any existing policies or ILM related templates.
When first setting up ILM, your initial template and policy will be applied.
You must set this to `true` when customizing your policies and template for them to be applied,
or if you want to switch between managed and unmanaged indices.

[float]
[[ilm-setup-policy-config]]
===== `apm-server.ilm.setup.require_policy`

Defaults to `true`, which means that an ILM policy must be defined in `apm-server.yml`.
Changing this to `false` allows you to manually set up ILM policies and templates outside of APM Server,
e.g., with Elasticsearch APIs.
APM Server will still make use of ILM and connect your template with the defined mapping.

[float]
[[ilm-setup-mapping-config]]
===== `apm-server.ilm.setup.mapping`

Maps each event type to the named policy. APM event types can only be `error`, `span`, `transaction`, and `metric`.
Policies defined must be mapped to an event type. If they are not, they will not be sent to Elasticsearch.
If you attempt to map an index lifecycle policy to a different event type, APM Server will not start.
If you only map a subset of APM event types, the default values will be used for omitted event types.
