Real User Monitoring captures user interaction with clients such as web browsers.
The {apm-rum-ref-v}/index.html[JavaScript Agent] is Elastic's RUM Agent.

=== Enable RUM support

By default, Real User Monitoring is disabled. To enable it, 
set `apm-server.rum.enabled` to `true` in your APM Server configuration file.

In addition, if APM Server is deployed in an origin different than the pageâ€™s origin,
you will need to configure {apm-rum-ref-v}/configuring-cors.html[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)] in the Agent.

A full list of APM Server configuration options is available in the <<configuration-rum,RUM configuration reference>>.

[[sourcemaps]]
=== Upload source Maps
For a number of reasons, it is common practice to minify JavaScript code, for example to reduce network latency.
While improving performance, minified code can be hard to debug.
A source map library helps by mapping the minified files back to the the original source code.

APM Server provides a <<sourcemap-api,Source Map API>> for uploading source maps.

By default, <<config-sourcemapping-enabled>> is set to `true`.
This means if a source map has previously been uploaded,
source mapping will automatically be applied all incoming transactions and errors.

Source maps are cached in memory for as long as the <<rum-sourcemap-cache,cache expiration>> setting indicates.

=== How source maps are applied

APM Server needs to find the correct source map for every `stack trace frame` in an event.
To do so, it tries the following:

* Compare the event's `service.name` with the source map's `service_name`
* Compare the event's `service.version` with the source map's `service_version`
* Compare the stack trace frame's `abs_path` with the source map's `bundle_filepath`

If a source map is found, the following attributes in the `stack trace frames` are overwritten:

* `filename`
* `function`
* `line number`
* `column number`
* `abs path` is https://golang.org/pkg/path/#Clean[cleaned] to be the shortest path name equivalent to the given path name.

If multiple source maps are found,
the one with the latest upload timestamp is used.

See what an <<sourcemap-example, example source map>> looks like in Elasticsearch.
