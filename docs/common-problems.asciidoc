== Common problems

This section describes common problems you might encounter with APM Server.

[float]
[[queue-is-full]]
=== 503: Queue is full

APM Server has an internal queue that buffers documents until they can be delivered to Elasticsearch.
The internal queue helps to: 

* alleviate problems that might occur if Elasticsearch is intermittently unavailable
* handle large spikes of data arriving at the APM Server at the same time
* send documents to Elasticsearch in bulk, instead of individually

When the internal queue is full,
APM Server returns an HTTP 503 status with the message "Queue is full".

A full queue generally means that the agents collect more data than APM server is able to deliver to Elasticsearch.
This might happen when APM Server is not configured properly for the size of your Elasticsearch cluster,
or because your Elasticsearch cluster is underpowered or not configured properly for the given workload.

The queue can also fill up if Elasticsearch is unavailable for a prolonged period,
or a sudden spike of data arrives at the APM Server.

To solve the "503: Queue is full" problem,
you have a few options:

* <<reduce-data,Reduce the amount of data collected>>
* <<tune-output-config,Tune the APM Server output configuration to your cluster>>
* <<increase-cluster-ingest,Tune Elasticsearch for higher ingestion>>
* <<increase-queue-size,Increase the size of the APM Server queue>>

[[request-timed-out]]
=== 503: Request timed out waiting to be processed

There is a limit to the number of requests that the APM Server can process concurrently.
The APM Server returns an HTTP 503 status with the message "Request timed out waiting to be processed" when the limit is reached and the request from an agent is blocked.
This limit is determined by the `apm-server.concurrent_requests` configuration parameter.

To alleviate this problem,
you can try to:

* <<reduce-data,Reduce the amount of data collected>>
* <<reduce-payload-size,Decrease the payload size>>
* <<add-apm-server-nodes,Add APM Server nodes>>

=== Solutions

[float]
[[tune-output-config]]
==== Tune APM Server output parameters for your Elasticsearch cluster

If your Elasticsearch cluster is sized properly,
but not ingesting the amount of data you expect,
you can tweak APM Server options to make better use of the cluster:

* Increase `output.elasticsearch.workers`
* Make sure that `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size` is high, for example 5120.
  The default of 50 is very conservative.
+
If you increase `bulk_max_size`,
make sure to also increase `queue.mem.size`.
A good rule of thumb is that `queue.mem.size` should equal `workers` multiplied by `bulk_max_size`.

[float]
[[increase-cluster-ingest]]
==== Tune Elasticsearch for higher ingestion

Increasing the Elasticsearch ingestion rate is a large topic.
See {ref}/tune-for-indexing-speed.html[Tune for indexing speed],
particularly the sections about how to increase the refresh interval,
disable swapping, use faster hardware, and set the indexing buffer size.

[float]
[[reduce-data]]
==== Reduce the amount of data collected

The most obvious way to reduce the number of documents to be indexed
is to reduce the _transaction sample rate_.
The transaction sample rate is controlled in the configuration of agents (for example for {apm-py-ref}/configuration.html#config-transaction-sample-rate[Python] and {apm-node-ref}/agent-api.html#transaction-sample-rate[Node.js]).

Reducing the transaction sample rate does not affect the collection of metrics such as Requests Per Second.

[float]
[[increase-queue-size]]
==== Increase internal queue size

A larger internal queue allows Elasticsearch to be unavailable for longer periods,
and it alleviates problems that might result from sudden spikes of data. 
You can increase the queue size by setting `apm-server.queue.mem.size`. 
Be aware that increasing `apm-server.queue.mem.size` can significantly affect APM Server memory usage. 

[float]
[[reduce-payload-size]]
==== Reduce the payload size

Large payloads coming from agents may result in "503: Request timed out waiting to be processed" messages.
You can reduce the payload size by decreasing the `max_queue_size` in the agents. 
This will result in agents sending smaller payloads to the APM Server,
but the requests will be more frequent.
See the documentation for the {apm-py-ref}/configuration.html#config-max-queue-size[Python] and {apm-node-ref}/agent-api.html#max-queue-size[Node.js] agents for more information.

[float]
[[add-apm-server-nodes]]
==== Add APM Server nodes

When the APM Server cannot process incoming requests quickly enough,
you will see "503: Request timed out waiting to be processed" messages.

The best way to avoid this problem is to add more processing power to your APM Server cluster.
You can either migrate your APM Server processes to more powerful machines or add more machines.
