== Common problems

This section describes common problems you might encounter with APM Server.

* <<no-data-indexed>>
* <<bad-request>>
* <<unauthorized>>
* <<forbidden>>
* <<request-too-large>>
* <<queue-full>>
* <<request-timed-out>>
* <<ssl-client-fails>>
* <<field-limit-exceeded>>

[[no-data-indexed]]
[float]
=== No data is indexed
If no data shows up in Elasticsearch, first check that the APM components are properly connected.

To ensure that APM Server configuration is valid and it can connect to the configured output, Elasticsearch by default,
run the following commands:

["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
apm-server test config
apm-server test output
------------------------------------------------------------

To see if the agent can connect to the APM Server, send requests to the instrumented service and look for lines
containing `[request]` in the APM Server logs.

If no requests are logged, it might be that SSL is <<ssl-client-fails, misconfigured>> or that the host is wrong.
Particularly, if you are using Docker, ensure to bind to the right interface (for example, set
`apm-server.host = 0.0.0.0:8200` to match any IP) and set the `SERVER_URL` setting in the agent accordingly.



If you see requests coming through the APM Server but they are not accepted (response code other than `202`), consider
the response code to narrow down the possible causes (see sections below).

Another reason for data not showing up is that the agent is not auto-instrumenting something you were expecting, check
the {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[agent documentation] for details on what is automatically instrumented.

[[bad-request]]
[float]
=== HTTP 400: Data decoding error / Data validation error

The most likely cause for this is that you are using incompatible versions of agent and APM Server.
For instance, APM Server 6.2.0 changed the Intake API spec and requires a minimum version of each agent.

[[unauthorized]]
[float]
=== HTTP 401: Invalid token

The <<secret-token, secret token>> in the request header doesn't match the configured in the APM Server.

[[forbidden]]
[float]
=== HTTP 403: Forbidden request

Either you are sending requests to a <<rum, RUM>> endpoint without RUM enabled, or a request
is coming from an origin not whitelisted in `apm-server.rum.allow_origins`. See the <<configuration-rum, RUM configuration>>.

[[request-too-large]]
[float]
=== HTTP 413: Request body too large

The agent is collecting too much data and sending it all at once. Consider increasing the `apm-server.max_unzipped_size`
setting in the APM Server, and adjust relevant settings in the agent.

[[queue-full]]
[float]
=== HTTP 503: Queue is full

APM Server has an internal queue that helps to:

* buffer data temporarily if Elasticsearch is intermittently unavailable
* handle sudden large spikes of data
* send documents to Elasticsearch in bulk, instead of individually

When the queue has reached the maximum size,
APM Server returns an HTTP 503 status with the message "Queue is full".

A full queue generally means that the agents collect more data than APM server is able to process.
This might happen when APM Server is not configured properly for the size of your Elasticsearch cluster,
or because your Elasticsearch cluster is underpowered or not configured properly for the given workload.

The queue can also fill up if Elasticsearch runs out of disk space.

If the APM Server only returns 503 responses, it indicates that an Elasticsearch disk might be full.
If the APM Server returns interleaved 503 and 202 responses, it indicates that the APM Server can't process that much data.

You have a few options to solve this problem:

* <<reduce-storage, Reduce storage>>
* <<tune-output-config>>
* <<adjust-queue-size>>
* <<tune-es, Tune Elasticsearch for higher ingestion>>

[[request-timed-out]]
[float]
=== HTTP 503: Request timed out waiting to be processed

This happens when APM Server exceeds the maximum number of requests that it can process concurrently.
This limit is determined by the `apm-server.concurrent_requests` configuration parameter deprecated[6.5].

To alleviate this problem,
you can try to:

* <<reduce-sample-rate>>
* <<reduce-stacktrace>>
* <<reduce-payload-size>>
* <<adjust-concurrent-requests>>
* <<add-apm-server-instances>>

[float]
[[ssl-client-fails]]
=== SSL client fails to connect

The target host running might be unreachable or the certificate may not be valid. To resolve your issue:

* Make sure that server process on the target host is running and you can connect to it.
First, try to ping the target host to verify that you can reach it from the host running {beatname_uc}.
Then use either `nc` or `telnet` to make sure that the port is available. For example:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ping <hostname or IP>
telnet <hostname or IP> 5044
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Verify that the certificate is valid and that the hostname and IP match.
+

* Use OpenSSL to test connectivity to the target server and diagnose problems.
See the https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/s_client.html[OpenSSL documentation] for more info.

==== Common SSL-Related Errors and Resolutions

Here are some common errors and ways to fix them:

* <<cannot-validate-certificate,x509: cannot validate certificate>>
* <<getsockopt-no-route-to-host,getsockopt: no route to host>>
* <<getsockopt-connection-refused,getsockopt: connection refused>>
* <<target-machine-refused-connection,No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it>>

[float]
[[cannot-validate-certificate]]
===== x509: cannot validate certificate for <IP address> because it doesn't contain any IP SANs

This happens because your certificate is only valid for the hostname present in the Subject field.

To resolve this problem, try one of these solutions:

* Create a DNS entry for the hostname mapping it to the server's IP.
* Create an entry in `/etc/hosts` for the hostname. Or on Windows add an entry to
`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
* Re-create the server certificate and add a SubjectAltName (SAN) for the IP address of the server. This makes the
server's certificate valid for both the hostname and the IP address.

[float]
[[getsockopt-no-route-to-host]]
===== getsockopt: no route to host

This is not an SSL problem. It's a networking problem. Make sure the two hosts can communicate.

[float]
[[getsockopt-connection-refused]]
===== getsockopt: connection refused

This is not an SSL problem. Make sure that Logstash is running and that there is no firewall blocking the traffic.

[float]
[[target-machine-refused-connection]]
===== No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it

A firewall is refusing the connection. Check if a firewall is blocking the traffic on the client, the network, or the
destination host.

[[field-limit-exceeded]]
[float]
=== Field limit exceeded

When adding too many distinct tag keys on a transaction or span, 
you risk creating a link:{ref}/mapping.html#mapping-limit-settings[mapping explosion].

For example,
you should avoid that user-specified data,
like URL parameters,
is used as a tag key.
Likewise,
using the current timestamp or a user ID as a tag key is not a good idea.
However,
tag *values* with a high cardinality are not a problem.
Just try to keep the number of distinct tag keys at a minimum.

The symptom of a mapping explosion is that transactions and spans are not indexed anymore after a certain time.
Usually,
on the next day,
the spans and transactions will be indexed again because a new index is created each day.
But as soon as the field limit is reached,
indexing stops again.

In the agent logs,
you won't see a sign of failures as the APM server asynchronously sends the data it received from the agents to Elasticsearch.
However,
the APM server and Elasticsearch log a warning like this:

----
{\"type\":\"illegal_argument_exception\",\"reason\":\"Limit of total fields [1000] in index [apm-7.0.0-transaction-2017.05.30] has been exceeded\"}
----
