=== Parse data using ingest pipelines

The APM integration loads default ingest node pipelines into {es}.
These pipelines preprocess and enrich APM documents before indexing them.
For example, a pipeline might define one processor that removes a field, and another that renames a field.

Pipelines can be used to ensure data security by removing or obfuscating sensitive information.
See <<apm-data-security,data security>> for an example.
