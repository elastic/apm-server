= Monitoring AWS Lambda Functions

Elastic APM lets you monitor your AWS Lambda functions.
The natural integration of <<apm-distributed-tracing,distributed tracing>> into your AWS Lambda functions provides insights into the functions' execution and runtime behavior as well as their relationships and dependencies to other services.

To get started with the setup of Elastic APM for your Lambda functions, checkout the language-specific guides:

* {apm-py-ref}/lambda-support.html[Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Python]
* {apm-java-ref}/aws-lambda.html[Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Java]

Or, see the {apm-lambda-ref}/aws-lambda-arch.html[architecture guide] to learn more about how the extension works,
