The index lifecycle management (ILM) feature in {es} allows you to automate the
lifecycle of your APM Server indices as they grow and age.
ILM is enabled by default, and a default policy is applied to all APM indices.

To view and edit these index lifecycle policies in {kib},
select *Stack Management* / *Index Lifecycle Management*.
Search for `apm`.

See {ref}/getting-started-index-lifecycle-management.html[manage the index lifecycle] for more information.
