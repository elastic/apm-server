= APM Attacher

preview::[]

The APM attacher for Kubernetes simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods.

The attacher includes a {apm-attacher-ref}/x.html[webhook receiver] that modifies pods so they are automatically
instrumented by an Elastic APM agent, and a {apm-attacher-ref}/x.html[Helm chart] that manages its lifecycle within
Kubernetes.
