preview::[]

The APM attacher for Kubernetes simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods.

The attacher includes a webhook receiver that modifies pods so they are automatically
instrumented by an Elastic APM agent, and a Helm chart that manages its lifecycle within
Kubernetes.
