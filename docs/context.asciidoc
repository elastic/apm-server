The contextual data describes the environment in which an event is recorded.
It includes the `service`, the `system` where the service runs, and the `process`.

It can also contain information about the authenticated `user`.

An event's context can also include information about an authenticated `user`, a request leading to it, or a response.
For instance, HTTP requests context have `url`, `cookies`, `body`, `headers`, etc.

The agents provide some settings for users to capture customized information. This data is stored as not-indexed in a `custom` object.
Searchable information is stored as `tags` instead.
