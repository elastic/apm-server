An event's context bundles information regarding the environment in which it is recorded.
It describes the `service` in which the event is captured, 
the `system` in which the monitored service is running and the event's `process` information.

It can also contain information about the authenticated `user`. 

An event's context can also include information about the request leading to the event and the response of processing the event. 
In case a http request is captured, it contains information about the `url`, `cookies`, `body`, `headers`, etc.

The agents provide some configuration options with which the users can also capture customized information.
The non-indexed information is captured within a `custom` object,
while the searchable information is stored within `tags`.
