= APM Server Docs (Experimental)

== Overview

Welcome to APM Server Docs.
The documentation pages are still work in progress.
For more details also check APM Server https://github.com/elastic/apm-server[Github repository].

APM Server is a central component in the Elastic APM system.
It receives data from APM agents and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents.
A single APM agent can handle data from multiple apps.

APM Server works by exposing an HTTP server to which agents post the APM data they collect.
This includes performance information about the applications as well as errors that occur in applications.

APM Server is an application built in Go using the beats framework and as such it shares many of the same configuration options as beats.
