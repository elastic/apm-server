=== OpenTelemetry intake API

APM Server supports receiving traces, metrics, and logs over the
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/[OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)].
OTLP is the default transfer protocol for OpenTelemetry and is supported natively by APM Server.

APM Server supports two OTLP communication protocols on the same port:

* OTLP/HTTP (protobuf)
* OTLP/gRPC
