== Self manage APM Server

++++
<titleabbrev>Self manage APM Server</titleabbrev>
++++

TIP: The easiest way to get started with Elastic APM is by using our
{ess-product}[hosted {es} Service] on {ecloud}.
The {es} Service is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
See <<apm-quick-start>> to get started in minutes.

// TODO: MOVE THIS
IMPORTANT: Starting in version 8.0.0, {fleet} uses the APM integration to set up and manage APM index templates,
{ilm-init} policies, and ingest pipelines. APM Server will only send data to {es} _after_ the APM integration has been installed.

The APM Server receives performance data from your APM agents,
validates and processes it, and then transforms the data into {es} documents.
If you're on this page, then you've chosen to self-manage the Elastic Stack,
and you now must decide how to run and configure the APM Server.
There are two options, and the components required are different for each:

* **<<setup-apm-server-binary,APM Server binary>>**
* **<<setup-fleet-managed-apm,Fleet-managed APM Server>>**
// * **<<setup-apm-server-ea,Standalone Elastic Agent-managed APM Server>>**

[float]
[[setup-apm-server-binary]]
=== APM Server binary

Install, configure, and run the APM Server binary wherever you need it.

image::./images/bin-ov.png[APM Server binary overview]

**Pros**:

- Simplest self-managed option
- No addition component knowledge required
- YAML configuration simplifies automation

**Supported outputs**:

- {es}
- {ess}
- {ls}
- Kafka
- Redis
- File
- Console

**Required components**:

- APM agents
- APM Server
- {stack}

**Configuration method**: YAML

[float]
[[setup-fleet-managed-apm]]
=== Fleet-managed APM Server

Fleet is a web-based UI in {kib} that is used to centrally manage {agent}s.
In this deployment model, use {agent} to spin up APM Server instances that can be centrally-managed in a custom-curated user interface.

NOTE: Fleet-managed APM Server does not have full feature parity with the APM Server binary method of running Elastic APM.

image::./images/fm-ov.png[APM Server fleet overview]

// (outputs, stable APIs)
// not the best option for a simple test setup or if only interested in centrally running APM Server

**Pros**:

- Conveniently manage one, some, or many different integrations from one central {fleet} UI.

**Supported outputs**:

- {es}
- {ess}

**Required components**:

- APM agents
- APM Server
- {agent}
- Fleet Server
- {stack}

**Configuration method**: {kib} UI

// [float]
// [[setup-apm-server-ea]]
// === Standalone Elastic Agent-managed APM Server
// // I really don't know how to sell this option
// Instead of installing and configuring the APM Server binary, let {agent} orchestrate it for you.
// Install {agent} and manually configure the agent locally on the system where it's installed.
// You are responsible for managing and upgrading {agent}. This approach is recommended for advanced users only.

// **Pros**:

// - Easily add integrations for other data sources
// useful if EA already in place for other integrations, and customers want to customize setup rather than using Fleet for configuration
// // TODO:
// // maybe get some more hints on this one from the EA team to align with highlighting the same pros & cons.

// **Available on Elastic Cloud**: ❌

// This supports all of the same outputs as binary
// see https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/issues/10467
// **Supported outputs**:

// **Configuration method**: YAML

// image::./images/ea-ov.png[APM Server ea overview]

// @simitt's notes for how to include EA-managed in the decision tree:
// ****
// If we generally describe Standalone Elastic Agent managed APM Server then we should also add it to this diagram:
// Do you want to use other integrations?
// -> yes: Would you like to use the comfort of Fleet UI based management? -> yes: Fleet managed APM Server; -> no: Standalone Elastic Agent managed APM Server
// -> no: What is your prefered way of configuration? -> yaml: APM Server binary; -> Kibana UI: Fleet managed APM Server
// ****

=== APM Server binary

This guide will explain how to set up and configure the APM Server binary.

[float]
==== Prerequisites

// tag::prereq[]
First, see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.

You'll need:

* *{es}* for storing and indexing data.
* *{kib}* for visualizing with the APM UI.

We recommend you use the same version of {es}, {kib}, and APM Server.
See {stack-ref}/installing-elastic-stack.html[Installing the {stack}]
for more information about installing these products.

If your environment has network traffic restrictions, there are other ways to install the APM integration.
See {fleet-guide}/air-gapped.html[Air-gapped environments] for more information.

Option 1: Update `kibana.yml`::
+
Update `kibana.yml` to include the following, then restart {kib}.
+
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.fleet.packages:
- name: apm
----

See {kibana-ref}/settings.html[Configure Kibana] to learn more about how to edit the Kibana configuration file.

Option 2: Use the {fleet} API::
+
Use the {fleet} API to install the APM integration. To be successful, this needs to be run against the {kib}
API, not the {es} API.

// end::install-apm-integration[]

[float]
===== Configure APM

Configure APM by editing the `apm-server.yml` configuration file.
The location of this file varies by platform--see the <<directory-layout>> for help locating it.

A minimal configuration file might look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apm-server:
  host: "localhost:8200" <1>
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"] <2>
  username: "elastic" <3>
  password: "changeme"
----
<1> The `host:port` APM Server listens on.
<2> The {es} `host:port` to connect to.
<3> This example uses basic authentication.
The user provided here needs the privileges required to publish events to {es}.
To create a dedicated user for this role, see <<privileges-to-publish-events>>.

All available configuration options are outlined in
{apm-guide-ref}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[configuring APM Server].

// *******************************************************
// STEP 3
// *******************************************************

[[apm-server-starting]]
==== Step 3: Start

In a production environment, you would put APM Server on its own machines,
similar to how you run {es}.
You _can_ run it on the same machines as {es}, but this is not recommended,
as the processes will be competing for resources.

To start APM Server, run:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
./apm-server -e
----------------------------------

NOTE: The `-e` <<global-flags,global flag>> enables logging to stderr and disables syslog/file output.
Remove this flag if you've enabled logging in the configuration file.
For Linux systems, see <<running-with-systemd,APM Server status and logs>>.

You should see APM Server start up.
It will try to connect to {es} on localhost port `9200` and expose an API to agents on port `8200`.
You can change the defaults in `apm-server.yml` or by supplying a different address on the command line:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
./apm-server -e -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=ElasticsearchAddress:9200 -E apm-server.host=localhost:8200
----------------------------------

[float]
[[running-deb-rpm]]
===== Debian Package / RPM

For Debian package and RPM installations, we recommend the `apm-server` process runs as a non-root user.
Therefore, these installation methods create an `apm-server` user which you can use to start the process.
In addition, {beatname_uc} will only start if the configuration file is
<<config-file-ownership,owned by the user running the process>>.

To start the APM Server in this case, run:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
sudo -u apm-server apm-server [<argument...>]
----------------------------------

By default, APM Server loads its configuration file from `/etc/apm-server/apm-server.yml`.
See the <<directory-layout,deb & rpm default paths>> for a full directory layout.

==== Step 4: Next steps

// Use a tagged region to pull APM Agent information from the APM Overview
If you haven't already, you can now install APM Agents in your services!

=== Fleet-managed APM Server

This guide will explain how to set up and configure a Fleet-managed APM Server.

[float]
==== Prerequisites

You need {es} for storing and searching your data, and {kib} for visualizing and managing it.
When setting these components up, you need:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/prereq.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

==== Step 1: Set up Fleet

Use {fleet} in {kib} to get APM data into the {stack}.
The first time you use {fleet}, you'll need to set it up and add a
{fleet-server}:

include::{ingest-docs-root}/docs/en/ingest-management/tab-widgets/add-fleet-server/content.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html[{fleet-server}].

==== Step 2: Add and configure the APM integration

include::{obs-repo-dir}/observability/tab-widgets/add-apm-integration/content.asciidoc[tag=self-managed]

****
An internet connection is required to install the APM integration via the Fleet UI in Kibana.

--
include::{docdir}/getting-started-apm-server.asciidoc[tag=install-apm-integration-no-internet]
--
****

==== Step 3: Install APM agents

APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name,
APM Server host, and Secret token.

* **Service name**: The APM integration maps an instrumented service's name–defined in each {apm-agent}'s configuration–
to the index that its data is stored in {es}.
Service names are case-insensitive and must be unique.
For example, you cannot have a service named `Foo` and another named `foo`.
Special characters will be removed from service names and replaced with underscores (`_`).

* **APM Server URL**: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.
This should match the host and port defined when setting up the APM integration.

* **Secret token**: Authentication method for {apm-agent} and APM Server communication.
This should match the secret token defined when setting up the APM integration.

TIP: You can edit your APM integration settings if you need to change the APM Server URL
or secret token to match your APM agents.

include::{tab-widget-dir}/install-agents-widget.asciidoc[]

==== Step 4: View your data

Back in {kib}, under {observability}, select APM.
You should see application performance monitoring data flowing into the {stack}!
