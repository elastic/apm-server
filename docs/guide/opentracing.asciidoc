== OpenTracing bridge

All Elastic APM agents have https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] compatible bridges.

The OpenTracing bridge allows you to create Elastic APM <<transactions,transactions>> and <<transaction-spans,spans>> using the OpenTracing API.
This means you can reuse your existing OpenTracing instrumentation to quickly and easily begin using Elastic APM.
