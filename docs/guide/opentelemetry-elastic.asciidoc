Elastic's OpenTelemetry integration allows you to reuse your existing OpenTelemetry
instrumentation to quickly analyze distributed traces and metrics with the Elastic Stack.

[[what-is-opentelemetry]]
=== What is OpenTelemetry?

> OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the creation and
management of telemetry data. It formed through a merger of the OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects.

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that provides the components necessary to observe your applications and services.
If you're unfamiliar with the project, see the {ot-spec}[spec] for more information.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-exporter]]
=== Elastic exporter

Elastic's integration is designed to drop into your current OpenTelemetry setup.
We've done this by extending the "contrib" OpenTelemetry collector and adding an Elastic exporter.
This exporter translates the OpenTelemetry trace data collected from your services to Elastic's protocol,
before sending the data to the Elastic Stack.
By extending the OpenTelemetry collector,
no changes are needed in your instrumented services in order to begin using the Elastic Stack.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-works]]
=== How the OpenTelemetry Collector works

The OpenTelemetry collector uses three different types of components to handle data: `receivers`, `processors`, and `exporters`.

* `receivers`: Configure how data gets to the collector. At least one receiver must be configured.
* `processors`: Defines optional transformations that occurs between receiving and exporting data.
* `exporters`: Configures how data is sent to its destination--in this case, the Elastic Stack.

Once a `receiver`, `processor`, and `exporter` is defined, `pipelines` can be configured in the `services` section of your configuration. Specifically, a `traces` pipeline will define the path of trace data through your collector, and bring all three of these components together.

TIP: More information is available in the
{ot-pipelines}[OpenTelemetry pipeline docs]

A final note: `extensions` can also be enabled for tasks like monitoring your collectors health.
See the {ot-extension}[OpenTelemetry extension readme]
for a list of supported extensions.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-get-started]]
=== Get started

NOTE: This guide assumes you've already instrumented your services with the OpenTelemetry API and/or SDK.
If you haven't, see the Elastic APM <<install-and-run,install and run guide>> to get started with Elastic APM Agents instead.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-deployment-planning]]
==== Plan your deployment

OpenTelemetry Collectors can be run as an Agent, or as standalone collectors.
They can be deployed as often as necessary and scaled up or out.

Deployment planning resources are available in OpenTelemetry's {ot-collector}[Getting Started]
documentation, and {ot-scaling}[Collector Performance] research.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-download]]
==== Download the collector

The Elastic exporter lives in the {ot-repo}[`opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository`],
and the latest release can be downloaded from {ot-repo}/releases[GitHub releases page].

Docker images are available on {ot-dockerhub}[dockerhub]:

[source,bash]
----
docker pull otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib-dev
----

You can also build the collector-contrib repository by cloning it and running:

[source,bash]
----
make otelcontribcol
----

[[open-telemetry-elastic-configure]]
==== Configure the collector

Create a `yaml` configuration file.

At a minimum, you must define the URL of the APM Server instance you are sending data to.
For example:

[source,yml]
----
exporters:
  elastic:
    apm_server_url: "https://elasticapm.example.com"
----

See the <<open-telemetry-elastic-config-ref,configuration reference>> for additional configuration options,
like specifying an API key, secret token, or TLS settings.

The Elastic exporter must also be defined in `service.pipelines.traces.exporters`.
For example:

[source,yml]
----
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      exporters: [elastic]
----

If we put everything together, here's an example configuration file that accepts input from an OpenTelemetry Agent,
processes the data, and sends it to an {ess} instance.

[source,yml]
----
receivers:
  otlp:
    endpoint: localhost:55680
processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 1024
exporters:
  elastic:
    apm_server_url: "https://elasticapm.example.com"
    secret_token: "ESS_TOKEN"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [elastic]
----

NOTE: For more information about getting started with an OpenTelemetry Collector,
see the {ot-collector}[OpenTelemetry collector] docs.
