https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] is a set
of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of
telemetry data from your services for greater observability. For more information about the
OpenTelemetry project, see the {ot-spec}[spec].

Elastic's OpenTelemetry integrations allow you to reuse your existing OpenTelemetry
instrumentation to quickly analyze distributed traces and metrics to help you monitor
business KPIs and technical components with the {stack}.

There are two Elastic OpenTelemetry integrations available:

* <<open-telemetry-elastic-exporter,Elastic exporter on the OpenTelemetry collector>> (recommmended)
* <<open-telemetry-elastic-protocol,APM Server native support of OpenTelemetry protocol>> (experimental)

[[open-telemetry-elastic-exporter]]
==== Elastic exporter on the OpenTelemetry collector

The recommended OpenTelemetry integration is using the Elastic exporter on the OpenTelemetry collector.
We have extended the "contrib" OpenTelemetry collector by adding an Elastic exporter so that you can drop this
integration into your current OpenTelemetry setup.

The architecture consists of three main components.

image::images/open-telemetry-exporter-arch.png[OpenTelemetry Elastic exporter architecture diagram]

|=== 

| *Agents* | The OpenTelemetry agents instrument the applications and exports the telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry collector.

| *OpenTelemetry collector* | Collects the telemetry data (https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#a-namereceiversaimg-width35-srchttpsrawgithubcomopen-telemetryopentelemetryiomainiconography32x32receiverssvgimg-receivers[receivers])
from the OpenTelemetry agent, defines optional transformations (https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#a-nameprocessorsaimg-width35-srchttpsrawgithubcomopen-telemetryopentelemetryiomainiconography32x32processorssvgimg-processors[processors])
between receiving and exporting the data (Elastic exporter).

| *Elastic exporter* | The exporter translates the OpenTelemetry trace data collected from your services
and the metrics data collected from your applications and infrastructure to Elastic's protocol.
By extending the OpenTelemetry collector, no changes are needed in your instrumented services to begin using the {stack}.

[[open-telemetry-collector-config]]
===== Download and configure the collector

OpenTelemetry Collectors can be run as an agent or as standalone collectors.
They can be deployed as often as necessary and scaled up or out. Deployment planning resources are available in
OpenTelemetry's {ot-collector}[Getting Started] documentation and {ot-scaling}[Collector Performance] research.

You can download the latest release of the Collector from the {ot-contrib}/releases[GitHub releases page]. The Elastic exporter
lives in the {ot-contrib}[`opentelemetry-collector-contrib` repository].

Docker images are available on {ot-dockerhub}[dockerhub]:

[source,bash]
----
docker pull otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
----

To configure the collector, create a `yaml` configuration file.

This example configuration file accepts input from an OpenTelemetry Agent, processes the data, and sends it to an {ess} instance.

[source,yml]
----
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:

      secret_token: 'APM_SERVER_SECRET_TOKEN'

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers:
          - otlp
          - hostmetrics
        exporters:

      traces:
        receivers:
          - otlp
        processors:
          - batch
        exporters:
          - elastic <4>
----
<1> The `hostmetrics` receiver must be defined to generate metrics about the host system scraped from various sources.
<2> At a minimum, you must define the URL of the APM Server instance you are sending data to. For additional configurations,
like specifying an API key, secret token, or TLS settings, see the Elastic exporter <<open-telemetry-elastic-config,configuration options>>.
<3> To translate metrics, you must define the Elastic exporter in `service.pipelines.metrics.exporters`.
<4> To translate trace data, you must define the Elastic exporter in `service.pipelines.traces.exporters`.

Once a `receiver`, `processor`, and `exporter` are defined, you can configure {ot-pipelines}[`pipelines`] in your configuration's `services` section.
The `traces` and `metrics` pipelines represent the path of trace data and metrics through your collector and bring all three of these components together.
You can also enable {ot-extension}[`extensions`] for tasks like monitoring the health of the collector.

TIP: We recommend using {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-overview.html[{metricbeat}] to get a mature collector with more integrations
and integrated visualizations to collect infrastructure metrics.

===== Instrument applications

To export traces and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector, ensure that you have instrumented your services and applications
with the OpenTelemetry API, SDK, or both. For example, if you are a Java developer, you need to execute your Java app using the
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation[OpenTelemetry agent for Java]. 

By defining the following environment variables, you can customize the OTLP endpoint the agent will use to communicate with
APM Server.

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=frontend,service.version=1.0-SNAPSHOT,deployment.environment=staging
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://apm_server_url:8200
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent-all.jar \
     -jar target/frontend-1.1.jar
----

|=== 

| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | The service name to identify your application.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | APM Server URL. The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.

|===

You are now ready to collect <<open-telemetry-elastic-traces-metrics,traces and metrics>>, <<open-telemetry-elastic-verify,verifying metrics>>,
and <<open-telemetry-elastic-kibana,visualizing metrics>> in {kib}.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-protocol]]
==== APM Server native support of OpenTelemetry protocol

experimental::[This feature is experimental and may be changed in a future release. It is only available in a self-managed environment.]

The APM Server native support of OpenTelemetry protocol integration allows you to send collected telemetry data directly from your applications to APM Server.
Trace data collected from your services and the metrics data collected from your applications and infrastructure are sent using the
OpenTelemetry protocol.

[[instrument-apps-apm-server]]
===== Instrument applications

To export traces and metrics to APM Server, ensure that you have instrumented your services and applications
with the OpenTelemetry API, SDK, or both. For example, if you are a Java developer, you need to execute your Java app using the
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation[OpenTelemetry agent for Java]. 

By defining the following environment variables, you can customize the OTLP endpoint so that the OpenTelemetry agent communicates with
APM Server.

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=checkoutService,service.version=1.1,deployment.environment=production
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://apm_server_url:8200
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer apm_secret_token"
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent-all.jar \
     -classpath lib/*:classes/ \
     com.mycompany.checkout.CheckoutServiceServer
----

|=== 

| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | The service name to identify your application.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | APM Server URL. The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Authorization header that includes the Elastic APM Secret token or API key. Please note the required space between `Bearer` and `apm-secret-token`.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE` | Certificate for TLS credentials of the gRPC client. (optional)

|===

You are now ready to collect <<open-telemetry-elastic-traces-metrics,traces and metrics>>, <<open-telemetry-elastic-verify,verifying metrics>>,
and <<open-telemetry-elastic-kibana,visualizing metrics>> in {kib}.

[float]
[[open-telemetry-elastic-traces-metrics]]
==== Collect traces and metrics

To export traces and metrics, ensure that you have instrumented your services and applications
with the OpenTelemetry API, SDK, or both.

Here is an example of how to capture business metrics from a Java application.

[source,java]
----
// initialize metric
Meter meter = GlobalMetricsProvider.getMeter("my-frontend");
DoubleCounter orderValueCounter = meter.doubleCounterBuilder("order_value").build();

public void createOrder(HttpServletRequest request) {

   // create order in the database
   ...
   // increment business metrics for monitoring
   orderValueCounter.add(orderPrice);
}
----

IMPORTANT: If collecting metrics, please note that the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/metrics/DoubleValueRecorder.html[`DoubleValueRecorder`]
and https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/metrics/LongValueObserver.html[`LongValueRecorder`] metrics are not yet supported.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-verify]]
==== Verify OpenTelemetry metrics data

Use *Discover* to validate that metrics are successfully reported to {kib}.

. Launch {kib}:
+
--
include::../tab-widgets/open-kibana-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. Open the main menu, then click *Discover*.
. Select `apm-*` as your index pattern.
. Filter the data to only show documents with metrics: `processor.name :"metric"`
. Narrow your search with a known OpenTelemetry field. For example, if you have an `order_value` field, add `order_value: *` to your search to return
only OpenTelemetry metrics documents.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-kibana]]
==== Visualize in {kib}

TSVB within {kib} is the recommended visualization for OpenTelemetry metrics. TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the
{es} aggregation framework's full power. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite number of aggregations to display complex data.

In this example eCommerce OpenTelemetry dashboard, there are four visualizations: sales, order count, product cache, and system load. The dashboard provides us with business
KPI metrics, along with performance-related metrics.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ecommerce-dashboard.png[OpenTelemetry visualizations]

Let's look at how this dashboard was created, specifically the Sales USD and System load visualizations.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.
. Click *Create dashboard*.
. Click *Save*, enter the name of your dashboard, and then click *Save* again.
. Let’s add a Sales USD visualization. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Create new* and then select *TSVB*.
. For the label name, enter Sales USD, and then select the following:
+
* Aggregation: `Positive Rate`.
* Field: `order_sum`.
* Scale: `auto`.
* Group by: `Everything`
. Click *Save*, enter Sales USD as the visualization name, and then click *Save and return*.
. Now let's create a visualization of load averages on the system. Click *Create new*.
. Select *TSVB*.
. Select the following:
+
* Aggregation: `Average`.
* Field: `system.cpu.load_average.1m`.
* Group by: `Terms`.
* By: `host.ip`.
* Top: `10`.
* Order by: `Doc Count (default)`.
* Direction: `Descending`.
. Click *Save*, enter System load per host IP as the visualization name, and then click *Save and return*.
+
Both visualizations are now displayed on your custom dashboard.

IMPORTANT: By default, Discover shows data for the last 15 minutes. If you have a time-based index
and no data displays, you might need to increase the time range.
