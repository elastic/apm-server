https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] is a set
of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of
telemetry data from your services for greater observability. For more information about the
OpenTelemetry project, see the {ot-spec}[spec].

Elastic OpenTelemetry integrations allow you to reuse your existing OpenTelemetry
instrumentation to quickly analyze distributed traces and metrics to help you monitor
business KPIs and technical components with the {stack}.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-protocol]]
==== APM Server native support of OpenTelemetry protocol


IMPORTANT: The https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticexporter#legacy-opentelemetry-collector-exporter-for-elastic[OpenTelemetry Collector exporter for Elastic]
was deprecated in 7.13 and replaced by the native support of the OpenTelemetry Line Protocol in
Elastic Observability (OTLP). To learn more, see 
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticexporter#migration[migration].

Elastic APM Server natively supports the OpenTelemetry protocol.
This means trace data and metrics collected from your applications and infrastructure can
be sent directly to Elastic APM Server using the OpenTelemetry protocol.

[[instrument-apps-apm-server]]
====== Instrument applications

To export traces and metrics to APM Server, ensure that you have instrumented your services and applications
with the OpenTelemetry API, SDK, or both. For example, if you are a Java developer, you need to instrument your Java app using the
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation[OpenTelemetry agent for Java].

By defining the following environment variables, you can configure the OTLP endpoint so that the OpenTelemetry agent communicates with
APM Server.

[source,bash]
----
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=checkoutService,service.version=1.1,deployment.environment=production
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://apm_server_url:8200
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer an_apm_secret_token"
java -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent-all.jar \
     -classpath lib/*:classes/ \
     com.mycompany.checkout.CheckoutServiceServer
----

|===

| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | The service name to identify your application.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | APM Server URL. The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Authorization header that includes the Elastic APM Secret token or API key: `"Authorization=Bearer an_apm_secret_token"` or `"Authorization=ApiKey an_api_key"`.

For information on how to format an API key, see our {apm-server-ref-v}/api-key.html[API key] docs.

Please note the required space between `Bearer` and `an_apm_secret_token`, and `APIKey` and `an_api_key`.

| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE` | Certificate for TLS credentials of the gRPC client. (optional)

|===

You are now ready to collect traces and <<open-telemetry-elastic-metrics,metrics>> before <<open-telemetry-elastic-verify,verifying metrics>>
and <<open-telemetry-elastic-kibana,visualizing metrics>> in {kib}.

TIP: When collecting infrastructure metrics, we recommend evaluating {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-overview.html[{metricbeat}] to get a mature collector with more integrations
and built-in dashboards.

You're now ready to export traces and metrics from your services and applications.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-metrics]]
==== Collect metrics

IMPORTANT: When collecting metrics, please note that the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/metrics/DoubleValueRecorder.html[`DoubleValueRecorder`]
and https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-api/latest/io/opentelemetry/api/metrics/LongValueObserver.html[`LongValueRecorder`] metrics are not yet supported.

Here's an example of how to capture business metrics from a Java application.

[source,java]
----
// initialize metric
Meter meter = GlobalMetricsProvider.getMeter("my-frontend");
DoubleCounter orderValueCounter = meter.doubleCounterBuilder("order_value").build();

public void createOrder(HttpServletRequest request) {

   // create order in the database
   ...
   // increment business metrics for monitoring
   orderValueCounter.add(orderPrice);
}
----

See the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/api.md[Open Telemetry Metrics API]
for more information.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-verify]]
===== Verify OpenTelemetry metrics data

Use *Discover* to validate that metrics are successfully reported to {kib}.

. Launch {kib}:
+
--
include::../tab-widgets/open-kibana-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. Open the main menu, then click *Discover*.
. Select `apm-*` as your index pattern.
. Filter the data to only show documents with metrics: `processor.name :"metric"`
. Narrow your search with a known OpenTelemetry field. For example, if you have an `order_value` field, add `order_value: *` to your search to return
only OpenTelemetry metrics documents.

[[open-telemetry-elastic-kibana]]
===== Visualize in {kib}

TSVB within {kib} is the recommended visualization for OpenTelemetry metrics. TSVB is a time series data visualizer that allows you to use the
{es} aggregation framework's full power. With TSVB, you can combine an infinite number of aggregations to display complex data.

In this example eCommerce OpenTelemetry dashboard, there are four visualizations: sales, order count, product cache, and system load. The dashboard provides us with business
KPI metrics, along with performance-related metrics.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ecommerce-dashboard.png[OpenTelemetry visualizations]

Let's look at how this dashboard was created, specifically the Sales USD and System load visualizations.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.
. Click *Create dashboard*.
. Click *Save*, enter the name of your dashboard, and then click *Save* again.
. Let’s add a Sales USD visualization. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Create new* and then select *TSVB*.
. For the label name, enter Sales USD, and then select the following:
+
* Aggregation: `Positive Rate`.
* Field: `order_sum`.
* Scale: `auto`.
* Group by: `Everything`
. Click *Save*, enter Sales USD as the visualization name, and then click *Save and return*.
. Now let's create a visualization of load averages on the system. Click *Create new*.
. Select *TSVB*.
. Select the following:
+
* Aggregation: `Average`.
* Field: `system.cpu.load_average.1m`.
* Group by: `Terms`.
* By: `host.ip`.
* Top: `10`.
* Order by: `Doc Count (default)`.
* Direction: `Descending`.
. Click *Save*, enter System load per host IP as the visualization name, and then click *Save and return*.
+
Both visualizations are now displayed on your custom dashboard.

IMPORTANT: By default, Discover shows data for the last 15 minutes. If you have a time-based index
and no data displays, you might need to increase the time range.

[[open-telemetry-aws-lambda-elastic]]
==== AWS Lambda Support

AWS Lambda functions can be instrumented with OpenTelemetry and monitored with Elastic Observability.

To get started, follow the official AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda[getting started documentation] and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to output traces and metrics to your Elastic cluster.

[[open-telemetry-aws-lambda-elastic-java]]
===== Instrumenting AWS Lambda Java functions

NOTE: For a better startup time, we recommend using SDK-based instrumentation, i.e. manual instrumentation of the code, rather than auto instrumentation.

To instrument AWS Lambda Java functions, follow the official https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-java[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda Support For Java].

Noteworthy configuration elements:

* AWS Lambda Java functions should extend `com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler`,
+
[source,java]
----
public class ExampleRequestHandler implements RequestHandler<APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent, APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent> {
    public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent event, Context context) {
        // add your code ...
    }
}
----

* When using SDK-based instrumentation, frameworks you want to gain visibility of should be manually instrumented
** The below example instruments https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/[OkHttpClient] with the OpenTelemetry instrument https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.opentelemetry.instrumentation/opentelemetry-okhttp-3.0/1.3.1-alpha/jar[io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-okhttp-3.0:1.3.1-alpha]
+
[source,java]
----
import io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.okhttp.v3_0.OkHttpTracing;

OkHttpClient httpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(OkHttpTracing.create(GlobalOpenTelemetry.get()).newInterceptor())
        .build();
----

* The configuration of the OpenTelemetry Collector, with the definition of the Elastic Observability endpoint, can be added to the root directory of the Lambda binaries (e.g. defined in `src/main/resources/opentelemetry-collector.yaml`)
+
[source,yaml]

[[open-telemetry-aws-lambda-elastic-java-terraform]]
===== Instrumenting AWS Lambda Java functions with Terraform

We recommend using an infrastructure as code solution like Terraform or Ansible to manage the configuration of your AWS Lambda functions.

Here is an example of AWS Lambda Java function managed with Terraform and the https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lambda_function[AWS Provider / Lambda Functions]:

* Sample Terraform code: https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/my-serverless-shopping-cart/tree/main/checkout-function/deploy
* Note that the Terraform code to manage the HTTP API Gateway (https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/my-serverless-shopping-cart/tree/main/utils/terraform/api-gateway-proxy[here]) is copied from the official OpenTelemetry Lambda sample https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda/tree/e72467a085a2a6e57af133032f85ac5b8bbbb8d1/utils[here]

[[open-telemetry-aws-lambda-elastic-nodejs]]
===== Instrumenting AWS Lambda Node.js functions

NOTE: For a better startup time, we recommend using SDK-based instrumentation for manual instrumentation of the code rather than auto instrumentation.

To instrument AWS Lambda Node.js functions, see https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-js[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda Support For JS].

Important configuration settings:

IMPORTANT: Due to a https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda/issues/118[limitation] in AWS Lambda Otel Layer for Node.js v0.19, you must create a trace in the calling invocation of the Node.js lambda functions. This is to force the sampling strategy to `sampled:true` passing a `traceparent` header with `sampled=true`. For example, with `-01` at the end of the value.

To create a trace in the calling invocation of the Lambda function, use these or other methods that result in the `traceparent` header being added to the outgoing HTTP call:

* If the caller is a web browser, instrument the caller using <<rum,Real User Monitoring (RUM)>> by enabling {apm-rum-ref}/distributed-tracing-guide.html[distributed tracing] on the RUM agent.
* If the caller is an application, instrument the application with an OpenTelemetry or Elastic APM agent ensuring distributed tracing is enabled.
