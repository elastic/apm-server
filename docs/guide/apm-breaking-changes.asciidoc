This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your application from one version of APM to another.

[[breaking-7.0.0-beta1]]
=== Breaking changes in 7.0.0-beta1

APM Server::
+
[[breaking-remove-v1]]
**Removed deprecated Intake v1 API endpoints.** Before upgrading APM Server, ensure all APM agents are upgraded to a version that supports APM Server >= 6.5. View the <<agent-server-compatibility, agent/server compatibility matrix>> to determine if your agent versions are compatible. 
+
[[breaking-ecs]]
**Moved fields in Elasticsearch to be compliant with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS).**
APM has aligned with the field names defined in the
https://github.com/elastic/ecs[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].
Utilizing this common schema will allow for easier data correlation within Elasticsearch.
+
See the <<ecs-compliance,ECS field changes>> table for full details on which fields have changed.

APM UI::
+
[[breaking-new-endpoints]]
**Moved to new data endpoints.**+
When you upgrade to 7.x, 
data in indices created prior to 7.0 will not automatically appear in the APM UI.
We offer a Kibana Migration Assistant (in the Kibana Management section) to help you migrate your data.
The migration assistant will reindex your older data in the new ECS format.
Be aware that this is a beta release.
This script is **not** meant to be run on production data at this stage.

[[breaking-6.4.0]]
=== Breaking changes in 6.4.0

We previously split APM data into separate indices (transaction, span, error, etc.).
In 6.4 APM Kibana UI starts to leverage those separate indices for queries.

In case you only update Kibana but run an older version of APM Server you will not be able to see any APM data by default.
To fix this, use the {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[Kibana APM settings] to specify the location of the APM index:
["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
apm_oss.errorIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.spanIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.transactionIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.onboardingIndices: apm-*
------------------------------------------------------------

In case you are upgrading APM Server from an older version, you might need to refresh your APM index pattern for certain APM UI features to work.
Also ensure to add the new config options in `apm-server.yml` in case you keep your existing configuration file:
["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------

    - index: "apm-%{[observer.version]}-sourcemap"
