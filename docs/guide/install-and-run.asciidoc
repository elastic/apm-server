[[install-and-run]]
== Install and run

The easiest way to get started with Elastic APM is by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP,
and automatically configures APM Server to work with {es} and {kib}.
Additional {cloud}/ec-manage-apm-settings.html[APM user settings] are also available.

Alternatively, you can install the stack yourself.

then skip straight to <<agents>>.

=== Install the stack yourself

image::images/apm-architecture-diy.png[Install Elastic APM yourself]

To install the stack yourself, first see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.
We recommend you use the same version of Elasticsearch, Kibana, and APM Server.

* <<install-elasticsearch>>
* <<install-kibana>>
* <<apm-server>>
* <<agents>>

[[install-elasticsearch]]
=== Step 1: Install Elasticsearch

// This will move to tagged regions so we can pull the installation instructions
// here (instead of linking out)

Install an Elasticsearch cluster, start it up, and make sure it's running.

* Verify that your system meets the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[minimum JVM requirements] for {es}.
* {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[Install Elasticsearch].
* {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_make_sure_elasticsearch_is_up_and_running[Make sure elasticsearch is up and running].

[[install-kibana]]
=== Step 2: Install Kibana

// This will move to tagged regions so we can pull the installation instructions
// here (instead of linking out)

Install Kibana, start it up, and open up the web interface:

* {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Install Kibana].
* {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_launch_the_kibana_web_interface[Launch the Kibana Web Interface].

[[apm-server]]
=== Step 3: Install APM Server

Let's get APM Server up and running.

* {apm-server-ref-v}/installing.html[Install APM Server].
* {apm-server-ref-v}/setting-up-and-running.html[Set up and Run APM Server].

Use the config file if you need to change the default configuration that APM Server uses to connect to Elasticsearch,
or if you need to specify credentials:

* {apm-server-ref-v}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[Configuring APM Server]
** {apm-server-ref-v}/configuration-process.html[General configuration options]
** {apm-server-ref-v}/elasticsearch-output.html[Configure the Elasticsearch output]

[[secure-api-access]]
If you do change the listen address from `localhost` to something that is accessible from outside of the machine,
we recommend setting up firewall rules to ensure that only your own systems can access the API.
Alternatively,
you can use a {apm-server-ref-v}/securing-apm-server.html[secret token and TLS].

If you have APM Server running on the same host as your service,
you can configure it to listen on a Unix domain socket.

[[more-information]]
TIP: For detailed instructions on how to install and secure APM Server in your server environment,
including details on how to run APM Server in a highly available environment,
please see the full {apm-server-ref-v}/index.html[APM Server documentation].

[[agents]]
=== Step 4: Install APM agents

Agents are written in the same language as your service.
Currently Elastic APM has agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript RUM.

// todo: fix this sentence
Setting up a new service to be monitored requires installing the agent,
and configuring it with the address of your APM Server and the service name.

NOTE: Check the <<agent-server-compatibility,Agent/Server compatibility matrix>> to ensure you're using agents that are compatible with your version of Elasticsearch.

[[choose-service-name]]
[float]
==== Choose a service name

The service name is used by Elastic APM to differentiate between data coming from different services.

Elastic APM includes the service name field on every document that it saves in Elasticsearch.
If you change the service name after using Elastic APM,
you will see the old service name and the new service name as two separate services.
Make sure you choose a good service name before you get started.

The service name can only contain alphanumeric characters,
spaces, underscores, and dashes (must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`).

=== What now?

You're now up and running with Elastic APM!
Don't forget to check out the <<components>> and <<apm-data-model>> documentation to gain a deeper understanding of how Elastic APM works.
