== Quick start guide

// Make tab-widgets work
include::../tab-widgets/code.asciidoc[]

This guide describes how to get started quickly with Elastic APM. Youâ€™ll learn how to:

* Spin up {es}, {kib}, and APM Server on {ess}
* Install APM agents
* Basic configuration options
* Visualize your APM data in {kib}

[[before-installation]]
=== Step 1: Spin up the Elastic Stack

[[agents]]
=== Step 2: Install APM agents

// This tagged region is reused in the Observability docs.
// tag::apm-agent[]
APM agents are written in the same language as your service.
To monitor a new service, you must install the agent and configure it with a service name, APM Server URL, and Secret token or API key.

[[choose-service-name]]
* *Service name*: Service names are used to differentiate data from each of your services.
Elastic APM includes the service name field on every document that it saves in Elasticsearch.
If you change the service name after using Elastic APM,
you will see the old service name and the new service name as two separate services.
Make sure you choose a good service name before you get started.
+
The service name can only contain alphanumeric characters,
spaces, underscores, and dashes (must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`).

* *APM Server URL*: The host and port that APM Server listens for events on.

* *Secret token or API key*: Authentication method for Agent/Server communication.
See {apm-server-ref-v}/secure-communication-agents.html[secure communication with APM Agents] to learn more.

Select your service's language for installation instructions:
// end::apm-agent[]

--
include::../tab-widgets/install-agents-widget.asciidoc[]
--

TIP: Check the {apm-overview-ref-v}/agent-server-compatibility.html[Agent/Server compatibility matrix] to ensure you're using agents that are compatible with your version of {es}.

[[configure-apm]]
=== Step 3: Advanced configuration (optional)

// This tagged region is reused in the Observability docs.
// tag::configure-agents[]
There are many different ways to tweak and tune the Elastic APM ecosystem to your needs.

*Configure APM agents*

APM agents have a number of configuration options that allow you to fine tune things like
environment names, sampling rates, instrumentations, metrics, and more.
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to configure APM agents:
// end::configure-agents[]

include::../tab-widgets/configure-agent-widget.asciidoc[]

*Configure APM Server*

include::../tab-widgets/configure-server-widget.asciidoc[]

[[visualize-kibana]]
=== Step 4: Visualize in {kib}

The APM app in {kib} allows you to monitor your software services and applications in real-time;
visualize detailed performance information on your services, identify and analyze errors,
and monitor host-level and agent-specific metrics like JVM and Go runtime metrics.

To open the APM app:

. Lauch {kib}:

--
include::../tab-widgets/open-kibana-widget.asciidoc[]
--

. In the side navigation, under *Observability*, select *APM*.

=== What's next?

Now that you have APM data streaming into {ES},
head over to the {kibana-ref}/xpack-apm.html[APM app reference] to learn more about what you can
do with {kib}'s APM app.
