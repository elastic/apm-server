[[install-and-run]]
== Install and run

The easiest way to get started with Elastic APM is by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure,
and automatically configures APM Server to work with {es} and {kib}.

Alternatively, you can <<before-installation,install the stack yourself>>.

Skip managing your own {es}, {kib}, and APM Server by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud.

then jump straight to <<agents>>.

[[before-installation]]
=== Install and manage the stack yourself

image::images/apm-architecture-diy.png[Install Elastic APM yourself]

To install the stack yourself, first see the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for information about supported operating systems and product compatibility.
We recommend you use the same version of Elasticsearch, Kibana, and APM Server.

* <<install-elasticsearch>>
* <<install-kibana>>
* <<apm-server>>
* <<agents>>

[[install-elasticsearch]]
=== Step 1: Install Elasticsearch

// This will move to tagged regions so we can pull the installation instructions
// here (instead of linking out)

Install an Elasticsearch cluster, start it up, and make sure it's running.

. Verify that your system meets the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[minimum JVM requirements] for {es}.
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-elasticsearch[Install Elasticsearch].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_make_sure_elasticsearch_is_up_and_running[Make sure elasticsearch is up and running].

[[install-kibana]]
=== Step 2: Install Kibana

// This will move to tagged regions so we can pull the installation instructions
// here (instead of linking out)

Install Kibana, start it up, and open up the web interface:

. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-kibana[Install Kibana].
. {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html#_launch_the_kibana_web_interface[Launch the Kibana Web Interface].

[[apm-server]]
=== Step 3: Install APM Server

Install, set up, and run APM Server.

. {apm-server-ref}/installing.html[Install APM Server].
. {apm-server-ref}/setting-up-and-running.html[Set up and Run APM Server].

Next, use the config file if you need to change the default configuration that APM Server uses to connect to Elasticsearch,
or if you need to specify credentials:

* {apm-server-ref}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[Configuring APM Server]
** {apm-server-ref}/configuration-process.html[General configuration options]
** {apm-server-ref}/elasticsearch-output.html[Configure the Elasticsearch output]

[[secure-api-access]]
If you do change the listen address from `localhost` to something that is accessible from outside of the machine,
we recommend setting up firewall rules to ensure that only your own systems can access the API.
Alternatively,
you can use a {apm-server-ref}/securing-apm-server.html[secret token and TLS].

If you have APM Server running on the same host as your service,
you can configure it to listen on a Unix domain socket.

[[more-information]]
TIP: For detailed instructions on how to install and secure APM Server in your server environment,
including details on how to run APM Server in a highly available environment,
please see the full {apm-server-ref}/index.html[APM Server documentation].

[[agents]]
=== Step 4: Install APM agents

Agents are written in the same language as your service.
Monitoring a new service requires installing the agent
and configuring it with the address of your APM Server, a secret token (if necessary), and a service name.

TIP: Check the <<agent-server-compatibility,Agent/Server compatibility matrix>> to ensure you're using agents that are compatible with your version of Elasticsearch.

[[choose-service-name]]
[float]
==== Choose a service name

The service name is used by Elastic APM to differentiate between data coming from different services.

Elastic APM includes the service name field on every document that it saves in Elasticsearch.
If you change the service name after using Elastic APM,
you will see the old service name and the new service name as two separate services.
Make sure you choose a good service name before you get started.

The service name can only contain alphanumeric characters,
spaces, underscores, and dashes (must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`).

[[configure-apm]]
=== Step 5: Configure APM

Now that you're up and running with Elastic APM, you may want to adjust some configuration settings.
Luckily, there are many different ways to tweak and tune the Elastic ecosystem to adapt it to your needs.


[float]
==== Configure APM agents

// Note about central config will go here
APM agents have a number of configuration options that allow you to fine tune things like
environment names, sampling rates, instrumentations, metrics, and more.

[float]
==== Configure Elastic Cloud

If you're running APM Server in Elastic cloud, you can configure your own user settings right in the Elasticsearch Service Console.
Any changes are automatically appended to the `apm-server.yml` configuration file for your instance.

Full details are available in the {cloud}/ec-manage-apm-settings.html[APM user settings] documentation.

[float]
==== Configure a self installation

If you've installed APM Server yourself, you can edit the `apm-server.yml` configuration file to make changes.
More information is available in {apm-server-ref}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[configuring APM Server].
