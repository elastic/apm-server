= Getting Started with APM

== Overview


APM is an application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack.
It uses Elasticsearch as its data store and allows you to monitor performance of thousands of applications in real time.

With APM, you can automatically collect detailed performance information from inside your applications and it requires only minor changes to your application.
APM will automatically instrument your application and measure the response time for incoming requests.
It also automatically measures what your application was doing while it was preparing the response.
For example, external database queries are measured to make it easy to detect slow queries.
It also measures calls to caches, external HTTP requests etc.
This makes it possible to pinpoint and fix performance problems and unhandled errors quickly and with minimal effort.

APM also automatically collects errors and exceptions that are not handled by your application.
When errors and exceptions get collected, they automatically get a checksum assigned based primarily of the stacktrace.
This makes it possible to discern new errors from errors that have been happening for some time.
It also makes it much easier to keep an eye on how many times specific errors happen.

=== APM Components
Elastic APM consists of four components:

* Elasticsearch
* APM agents
* APM Server
* Kibana APM UI

image::apm-architecture.png[Architecture of Elastic APM]

*APM agents* are open source libraries written in the same language as your application.
You install them into your application as you would install any other library.
The agents hook into your application and start collecting performance metrics and errors automatically when your application starts.
All data that gets collected by agents is buffered for a short period and sent on to APM Server.
This happens once per minute, by default.

Out of the box, APM automatically instruments most popular web frameworks, database drivers, calls to caching servers, and HTTP libraries for requests to external services.
For everything else, the agents provide an API that you can call from your application to manually instrument anything you find interesting.

*APM Server* is an open source application written in Go which runs on your servers.
It listens on port 8200 by default and receives data from agents periodically.
The API is a simple JSON based HTTP API.
APM Server builds Elasticsearch documents from the data received from agents.
These documents are stored in an Elasticsearch cluster.
A single APM Server process can typically handle data from hundreds of agents.

To visualize the data after it's sent to Elasticsearch, you can use the pre-built, open source Kibana dashboards that come with APM Server.

We designed Elastic APM to run on anything from a regular laptop to thousands of machines, and it's easy to get started.

== Install and run Elastic APM

To get started using Elastic APM, you need to have:

* an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana (version 5.6 or above)
* a running APM Server process
* APM agents installed in your applications


For information about setting up an Elasticsearch cluster, see the Elasticsearch {ref}/getting-started.html[Getting Started].
To view the collected data, you need Kibana.

The following sections show how to get started quickly with Elastic APM on a local machine.

[float]
=== Install and run APM Server

First, https://apm-server-snapshots.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html[download APM Server] for your operating system and extract the package.

In a production environment, you would put APM Server on it's own machines, similar to how you run Elasticsearch.
You _can_ run it on the same machines as Elasticsearch, but this is not recommended, as the processes will be competing for resources.

To start APM Server, run:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
$ ./apm-server
----------------------------------

You should see APM Server start up. It will try to connect to Elasticsearch on localhost port 9200 and expose an API to agents on port 8200. You can change the defaults by supplying a different addresses on the command line:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
$ ./apm-server -e -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=ElasticsearchAddress:9200 -E apm-server.host=localhost:8200
----------------------------------

Or you can update the `apm-server.yml` configuration file to change the defaults.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
apm-server:
  host: localhost:8200

output:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ElasticsearchAddress:9200
----------------------------------

[float]
==== Secure access to the API
The HTTP API exposed by APM Server listens on `localhost` and port 8200 by default.
If you change the listen address from `localhost` to something that is accessible from outside of the machine, we recommend setting up firewall rules to ensure that only your own systems can access the API.
Alternatively, you can use the {apm-server-ref}/_security.html[secret token and TLS] to secure access to APM Server API.

[[dashboards]]
[float]
==== Install the Kibana dashboards
APM Server comes with predefined Kibana dashboards for the APM data. To install the Kibana dashboards, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:5601/api/kibana/dashboards/import -H 'Content-type:application/json' -H 'kbn-xsrf:true' -d @./_meta/kibana/default/dashboard/apm-dashboards.json
----------------------------------

If you using an X-Pack secured version of Elastic Stack, add `--user user:pass` to the command.

.More information
For detailed instructions on how to install and secure APM Server in your server environment, including details on how to run APM Server in a highly available environment, please see APM Server documentation.

Once APM Server is up and running, you need to install an agent in your application.

[float]
=== Install and configure APM agents

Agents are written in the same language as your application.
Currently, Elastic APM has agents for Node.js and for Python.

Setting up a new application to be monitored requires installing the agent in the application, coming up with a good app name for the application, and then configuring the agents so they know the address of your APM Server and the app name.

[float]
==== Choose an app name

The app name is used by Elastic APM to differentiate between data coming from different applications and to group data coming from the same applications.
When configuring an agent, you need to supply an app name.

Elastic APM includes the app name field on every document that it saves in Elasticsearch.
This has the implication that if you change the app name after using Elastic APM for some time, you will see the old app name and the new app name as two separate applications.
Make sure you choose a good app name before you get started.

The app name can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, underscores, and dashes (must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`).

[float]
==== Install the Node.js agent

To install the Node.js agent, simply install the elastic-apm module from npm in your application:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
$ npm install elastic-apm --save
----------------------------------

Then configure the elastic-apm module inside your application by adding the following lines to the very top of your application code:

[source,javascript]
----------------------------------
// Add this to the VERY top of the first file loaded in your app
var apm = require('elastic-apm').start({
  // Set required app name (allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space)
  appName: '',

  // Set custom APM Server URL (default: http://localhost:8200)
  serverUrl: ''
})
----------------------------------

The Node.js agent supports Express, hapi and Koa out of the box. 
See the {apm-node-ref}/index.html[individual agent documentation] for more information.

[float]
==== Install the Python agent

To install the Python agent, install the Elastic APM module from pypi:

[source,bash]
----------------------------------
$ pip install elastic-apm
----------------------------------

The Python agent supports Django and Flask out of the box.
See https://www.elastic.co/downloads/apm/django[Getting started with Django] or https://www.elastic.co/downloads/apm/flask[Getting started with Flask] for more information on how to get started.

[float]
=== Set up Kibana

You can use the `dashboards` that are packaged with APM Server, as mentioned above.
