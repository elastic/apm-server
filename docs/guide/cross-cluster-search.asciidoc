== Cross-cluster search

Elastic APM utilizes Elasticsearch's cross-cluster search functionality.
Cross-cluster search lets you run a single search request against one or more
{ref}/modules-remote-clusters.html[remote clusters] --
making it easy to search APM data across multiple sources.
This means you can also have deployments per data type, making sizing and scaling more predictable,
and allowing for better performance while managing multiple observability use cases.

=== Set up cross-cluster search

*Step 1. Set up remote clusters.*

If you're using the Hosted Elasticsearch Service, see {cloud}/ec-enable-ccs.html[Enable cross-cluster search].

You can add remote clusters directly in Kibana, under *Management* > *Elasticsearch* > *Remote clusters*.
All you need is a name for the remote cluster and the seed node(s).
Remember the names of your remote clusters, you'll need them in step two.
See {kibana-ref}/working-remote-clusters.html#managing-remote-clusters[managing remote clusters] for detailed information on the setup process.

Alternatively, you can {ref}/modules-remote-clusters.html#configuring-remote-clusters[configure remote clusters]
in Elasticsearch's `elasticsearch.yml` file.

*Step 2. Edit the default APM app index pattern.*

The APM app index pattern determines from which clusters and indices to display data.
Index patterns follow this convention: `<cluster-names>:<pattern>`.
The default value is `apm-*`, which displays data from any index beginning with `apm-`.

To display data from the local cluster, and all remote clusters,
you'll need to update the index pattern to: `*:apm-*,apm-*`.
You can also specify certain clusters to display data from, for example, `obs-1:apm-*,obs-2:apm-*`.

There are two ways to edit the default index pattern:

* In the APM app -- Navigate to *APM* > *Settings* > *Indices*, and change all `apm_oss.*Pattern` values to
include the new index pattern, e.g., `*:apm-*,apm-*`.
* In `kibana.yml` -- All of the {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[`apm_oss.*Pattern`] configuration values must
include the new index pattern, e.g., `*:apm-*,apm-*`.
