[[apm-data-model]]
== Data Model

Elastic APM agents capture different types of information from within their instrumented applications.
These are known as events, and can be `spans`, `transactions`, `errors`, or `metrics`.

* <<transaction-spans>>
* <<transactions>>
* <<errors>>
* <<metrics>>

Events can contain additional <<metadata,metadata>> which further enriches your data.

[[transaction-spans]]
=== Spans

*Spans* contain information about a specific code path that has been executed.
They measure from the start to end of an activity,
and they can have a parent/child relationship with other spans.

Agents automatically instrument a variety of libraries to capture these spans from within your application.
In addition, you can use the Agent API for ad hoc instrumentation of specific code paths. 

A span contains:

* A `transaction.id` attribute that refers to their parent <<transactions,transaction>>.
* A `parent.id` attribute that refers to their parent span, or their transaction.
* start time and duration
* name
* type
* `stack trace` (optional)

TIP: Most agents limit keyword fields (e.g. `span.id`) to 1024 characters,
and non-keyword fields (e.g. `span.start.us`) to 10,000 characters.

Spans are stored in {apm-server-ref-v}/span-indices.html[span indices].
Note that these indices are separate from {apm-server-ref-v}/transaction-indices.html[transaction indices] by default.

[float]
[[dropped-spans]]
==== Dropped Spans

For performance reasons, some APM agents can choose to purposefully sample or omit spans.
One example of this might be for long running transactions with over 100 spans.
These edge cases can overload both the agent and the APM Server.
To avoid this, agents will drop spans. When they do this,
they notify the server of exactly how many spans were dropped.
This note is then passed on to the user in the UI.

Settings affecting dropped spans, and more details on why they might occur,
are available in the relevant agent documentation:

* {apm-node-ref-v}/configuration.html#transaction-max-spans[Node.js Agent max spans]
* {apm-py-ref-v}/configuration.html[Python Agent max spans]

[float]
[[missing-spans]]
==== Missing Spans

Similarly to dropped spans, transactions may have missing spans.
This can happen because spans are streamed from the APM Agent to the APM Server separately from their transaction.
Unforseen errors may cause spans to go missing.
Because the agent notifies the server about how many spans there should be,
the number of missing spans is able to be calculated and shown in the UI.

[[transactions]]
=== Transactions

*Transactions* are a special kind of <<transaction-spans,span>> that have additional attributes associated with them.
They describe an event captured by an Elastic APM agent instrumenting a service.
You can think of transactions as the highest level of work youâ€™re measuring within a service.
As an example, a transaction might be a:

* Request to your server
* Batch job
* Background job
* Custom transaction type

Agents decide whether to sample transactions or not,
and provide settings to control sampling behavior.
If sampled, the <<transaction-spans,spans>> of a transaction are sent and stored as separate documents.
Within one transaction there can be 0, 1, or many spans captured.

A transaction contains:

* The timestamp of the event
* A unique id, type, and name
* Data about the environment in which the event is recorded:
** Service - environment, framework, language, etc.
** Host - architecture, hostname, IP, etc.
** Process - args, PID, PPID, etc.
** URL - full, domain, port, query, etc.
** <<user-fields,User>> - (if supplied) email, ID, username, etc.
* Other relevant information depending on the agent. Example: The JavaScript RUM agent captures transaction marks,
which are points in time relative to the start of the transaction with some label.

In addition, agents provide options for users to capture custom <<metadata, metadata>>.
Metadata can be indexed - <<labels-fields,`labels`>>, or not-indexed - <<custom-fields,`custom`>>.

Transactions are grouped by their `type` and `name` in the APM UI's
{kibana-ref}/transactions.html[Transaction overview].
If you're using a supported framework, APM agents will automatically handle the naming for you.
If you're not, or if you wish to override the default,
all agents have API methods to manually set the `type` and `name`.

* `type` should be a keyword of specific relevance in the service's domain,
e.g. `request`, `backgroundjob`, etc.
* `name` should be a generic designation of a transaction in the scope of a single service,
e.g. `GET /users/:id`, `UsersController#show`, etc.

TIP: Most agents limit keyword fields (e.g. `labels`) to 1024 characters,
non-keyword fields (e.g. `span.db.statement`) to 10,000 characters.

Transactions are stored in {apm-server-ref-v}/transaction-indices.html[transaction indices].

[[errors]]
=== Errors

An error event contains at least
information about the original `exception` that occurred
or about a `log` created when the exception occurred.
For simplicity, errors are represented by a unique ID.

An Error contains:

* Both the captured `exception` and the captured `log` of an error can contain a `stack trace`,
which is helpful for debugging.
* The `culprit` of an error indicates where it originated.
* An error might relate to the <<transactions,transaction>> during which it happened,
via the `transaction.id`.
* Data about the environment in which the event is recorded:
** Service - environment, framework, language, etc.
** Host - architecture, hostname, IP, etc.
** Process - args, PID, PPID, etc.
** URL - full, domain, port, query, etc.
** <<user-fields,User>> - (if supplied) email, ID, username, etc.

In addition, agents provide options for users to capture custom <<metadata,metadata>>.
Metadata can be indexed - <<labels-fields,`labels`>>, or not-indexed - <<custom-fields,`custom`>>.

TIP: Most agents limit keyword fields (e.g. `error.id`) to 1024 characters,
non-keyword fields (e.g. `error.exception.message`) to 10,000 characters.

Errors are stored in {apm-server-ref-v}/error-indices.html[error indices].

[[metrics]]
=== Metrics

APM agents automatically pick up basic host-level metrics,
including system and process-level CPU and memory metrics.
Agent specific metrics are also available,
like {apm-java-ref-v}/metrics.html[JVM metrics] in the Java Agent,
and {apm-go-ref-v}/metrics.html[Go runtime] metrics in the Go Agent.

Infrastructure and application metrics are important sources of information when debugging production systems,
which is why we've made it easy to filter metrics for specific hosts or containers in the Kibana {kibana-ref}/metrics.html[metrics overview].

Metrics have the `processor.event` property set to `metric`.

TIP: Most agents limit keyword fields (e.g. `processor.event`) to 1024 characters,
non-keyword fields (e.g. `system.memory.total`) to 10,000 characters.

Metrics are stored in {apm-server-ref-v}/metricset-indices.html[metric indices].

For a full list of tracked metrics, see the relevant agent documentation:

* {apm-go-ref-v}/metrics.html[Go]
* {apm-java-ref-v}/metrics.html[Java]
* {apm-node-ref-v}/metrics.html[Node.js]
* {apm-py-ref-v}/metrics.html[Python]
* {apm-ruby-ref-v}/metrics.html[Ruby]

[[metadata]]
=== Metadata

Metadata can enrich your events and make application performance monitoring even more useful.
Let's explore the different types of metadata that Elastic APM offers.

[float]
[[labels-fields]]
==== Labels

Labels are used to add *indexed* information to transactions, spans, and errors.
Indexed means the data is searchable and aggregatable in Elasticsearch.
Multiple labels can be defined with different key-value pairs.

* Indexed: Yes
* Elasticsearch type: {ref}/object.html[object]
* Elasticsearch field: `labels` (`context.tags` in APM Server pre-7.0)
* Applies to <<transactions>> | <<transaction-spans>> | <<errors>>

Label values can be a string, boolean, or number in APM Server 6.7+.
Using this API in combination with an older APM Server version leads to validation errors.
In addition, some agents only support string values at this time.
Because labels for a given key, regardless of agent used, are stored in the same place in Elasticsearch,
all label values of a given key must have the same data type.
Multiple data types per key will throw an exception, e.g. `{foo: bar}` and `{foo: 42}`

IMPORTANT: Avoid defining too many user-specified labels.
Defining too many unique fields in an index is a condition that can lead to a
{ref}/mapping.html#mapping-limit-settings[mapping explosion].

[float]
[[custom-fields]]
==== Custom context

Custom context is used to add *non-indexed*,
custom contextual information to transactions and errors.
Non-indexed means the data is not searchable or aggregatable in Elasticsearch,
and you cannot build dashboards on top of the data.
This also means you do not have to worry about {ref}/mapping.html#mapping-limit-settings[mapping explosions],
as these fields are not added to the mapping.

Non-indexed information is useful for providing contextual information to help you
quickly debug performance issues or errors.

* Indexed: No
* Elasticsearch type: {ref}/object.html[object]
* Elasticsearch fields: `transaction.custom` | `error.custom`
* Applies to <<transactions>> | <<errors>>

IMPORTANT: Setting a circular object, large object, or a non JSON serializable object can lead to errors.

[[user-fields]]
==== User context

User context is used to add *indexed* user information to transactions and errors.
Indexed means the data is searchable and aggregatable in Elasticsearch.

* Indexed: Yes
* Elasticsearch type: {ref}/keyword.html[keywords]
* Elasticsearch fields: `user.email` | `user.name` | `user.id`
* Applies to <<transactions>> | <<errors>>
