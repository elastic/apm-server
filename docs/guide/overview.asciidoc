== Overview

Elastic APM is an application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack.
It allows you to monitor software services and applications in real time,
collecting detailed performance information on response time for incoming requests,
database queries, calls to caches, external HTTP requests,
etc.
This makes it easier to pinpoint and fix performance problems quickly.

Elastic APM also automatically collects unhandled errors and exceptions.
Errors are grouped based primarily on the stacktrace,
so you can identify new errors as they appear and keep an eye on how many times specific errors happen. 

NOTE: This guide will indiscriminately use the word "service" for both services and applications.

=== APM Components

Elastic APM consists of four components:

{apm-agents-ref}/index.html[*APM agents*] are open source libraries written in the same language as your service.
You install them into your service as you would install any other library.
They instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime.
This data is buffered for a short period and sent on to APM Server.

{apm-server-ref-v}/index.html[*APM Server*] is an open source application written in Go which typically runs on dedicated servers.
It listens on port 8200 by default and receives data from agents through a JSON HTTP API.
Then it creates documents from that data and stores them in Elasticsearch.

{ref}/index.html[*Elasticsearch*] is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine.
It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.
Elasticsearch is used to store APM performance metrics and make use of its aggregations. 

{kibana-ref}/xpack-apm.html[*Kibana*] is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch.
You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch.
You an use Kibana to visualize APM data by utilizing the dedicated APM UI bundled in Basic license,
or the pre-built, open source,
Kibana dashboards that can be loaded directly via the {kibana-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[APM Kibana UI].

=== Get Started
To get started, simply use an existing cluster or grab a fresh installation of the Elastic Stack,
spin up an APM Server, and add a bit of code to instrument your app with agents.
Full details are available on the <<install-and-run,install and run>> page.
