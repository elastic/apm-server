== Overview

Elastic APM is an application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack.
It allows you to monitor software services and applications in real time,
collecting detailed performance information on response time for incoming requests,
database queries, calls to caches, external HTTP requests,
etc.
This makes it easier to pinpoint and fix performance problems quickly.

Elastic APM also automatically collects unhandled errors and exceptions.
Errors are grouped based primarily on the stacktrace,
so you can identify new errors as they appear and keep an eye on how many times specific errors happen. 

NOTE: This guide will indiscriminately use the word service for both services and applications.

=== APM Components

Elastic APM consists of four components:

* {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[APM agents]
* {apm-server-ref}/index.html[APM Server]
* {ref}/index.html[Elasticsearch]
* {kibana-ref}/xpack-apm.html[Kibana APM UI]

*APM agents* are open source libraries written in the same language as your service.
You install them into your service as you would install any other library.
They instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime.
This data is buffered for a short period and sent on to APM Server.

*APM Server* is an open source application written in Go which typically runs on dedicated servers.
It listens on port 8200 by default and receives data from agents through a JSON HTTP API.
Then it creates documents from that data and stores them in Elasticsearch.

*Elasticsearch* is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine.
It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.

*Kibana* is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch.
You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices.
You an use Kibana to visualize APM data by utilizing the dedicated APM UI bundled in Basic license,
or the pre-built, open source,
Kibana dashboards that can be loaded directly via the {kibana-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[APM Kibana UI].

=== APM Concepts

*Agents*
APM Agents capture different types of information from within their instrumented applications, known as events. Events can be <<transactions,`Transactions`>>, <<transaction-spans,`Spans`>>, and <<errors,`Errors`>>.
These events are then streamed to a single endpoint in the APM Server which sorts and processes the events. 

* <<transactions,`Transactions`>> - A transaction describes an event captured by an Elastic APM agent instrumenting a service. For example: an HTTP request, or a background job.
* <<transaction-spans,`Spans`>> - Transactions can have 0, 1, or many spans. A span contains information about a specific code path that has been executed as part of a transaction.
* <<errors,`Errors`>> - An error event contains information about the original exception that occurred or about a log created when the exception occurred.

*Server*
The APM Server is a {apm-server-ref}/why-separate-component.html[separate component by design] - it helps keep the agents light, prevents certain security risks, and improves compatibility across the Elastic and APM Stack.  

The {apm-server-ref}/intake-api.html[Intake API] is what we call the internal protocol that APM agents use to talk to the APM Server. 
After the APM Server has sorted and processed events from the APM agents (via the intake API), the server transforms the data into Elasticsearch documents and stores them in corresponding {apm-server-ref}/exploring-es-data.html[Elasticsearch indices]. In a matter of minutes you can start viewing your application performance data in the {kibana-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[Kibana UI] using our prebuilt dashboards.

*Real User Monitoring (RUM)*
Real User Monitoring captures user interaction with clients such as web browsers. The {apm-rum-ref}[JavaScript Agent] is Elasticâ€™s RUM Agent. To use it you need to {apm-server-ref}/rum.html[enable RUM support] in the APM Server.

Unlike Elastic APM backend agents which monitor requests and responses, the RUM JS agent monitors the real user experience and interaction within your client-side application. The RUM JS agent is also framework-agnostic, which means it can be used with any frontend JavaScript application.

You will be able to measure metrics such as "Time to First Byte", domInteractive, and domComplete which helps you discover performance issues within your client-side application as well as issues that relate to the latency of your server-side application.

*Distributed Tracing*
All of our APM agents have been updated to support <<distributed-tracing,distributed tracing>> out of the box. Distributed tracing enables you to analyze performance throughout your microservices architecture all in one view. This means that APM agents automatically look for a `trace_id` in the HTTP header of incoming requests, and propagate that id to child services. If there is no `trace_id`, the agent will generate a unique id and pass it on.

*Get Started*
To get started, simply use an existing cluster or grab a fresh installation of the Elastic Stack, spin up an APM Server, and add a bit of code to instrument your app with agents. Full details are available on the <<install-and-run,install and run>> page.
