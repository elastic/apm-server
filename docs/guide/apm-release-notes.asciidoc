=== APM version 7.3.0

// tag::notable-v73-highlights[]

==== Elastic APM .NET Agent GA

https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/[Elastic APM agent for .NET] is now
generally available! The .NET Agent adds automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET
Core 2.x+ and Entity Framework Core 2.x+, while also providing a
{apm-dotnet-ref-v}/public-api.html[Public API] for the .NET agent that will allow
you to instrument any .NET custom application code.

==== Aggregate service breakdown charts

beta[] In addition to the transaction duration and throughput charts, the 7.3
release adds aggregated service breakdown charts for services. These charts help
you visualize where your application and services are spending most of their
time, allowing you to get to the root cause of a performance problem quickly.
These charts are available in Beta with support for certain APM agents(Java, Go,
Node.js, Python).

==== Agent sample rate configuration from APM UI

beta[] Configuring sampling rate for your services is a whole lot easier with this
release. The new settings page now lets you view and configure the sampling rate
for your services from within the APM UI without restarting them. To learn more
about this configuration, see
{kibana-ref}/agent-configuration.html[APM Agent configuration].

==== React support for Single Page Applications

The 7.3 release also brings a lot of exciting changes to the Real User
Monitoring (RUM) agent. We have furthered our support of Single Page
Applications (SPA). You can now use the RUM agent to instrument your SPA written
in React.js without the need to manually create or rename transactions. For
more information, see {apm-rum-ref}/react-integration.html[React integration].

===== APM RUM integration with Elastic Maps

This release also makes both the geo-ip and user-agent modules enabled by
default, which makes it easier for you to integrate with
https://www.elastic.co/products/maps[Maps] so you can better understand the
performance of your RUM applications.

[[release-highlights-7.2.0]]
=== APM version 7.2.0

[float]
==== New features

*APM Server*

* Added support for {apm-server-ref-v}/ilm.html[index lifecycle management (ILM)]:
ILM enables you to automate how you want to manage your indices over time,
by automating rollovers to a new index when the existing index reaches a specified size or age.
* Added Geo-IP processing to the default ingest pipeline:
Pipelines are still disabled by default, but activation now includes a new Geo-IP pipeline.
The Geo-IP pipeline takes an extracted IP address from RUM events and stores it in the `client.geo` field.
This makes it much easier to use location data in Kibana's Visualize maps and Maps app directly:

*APM UI*

* APM + Uptime integration: APM transactions now include links to the Uptime UI when data is available.
* Added a global filter for {kibana-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[service environments]:
You can now easily name and switch between environments in the APM UI.
* Added support for {kibana-ref}/metrics.html[agent specific metrics]:
Java is the first to get custom metrics in the APM UI, with more agents to follow.

[[release-notes-6.4.1]]
=== APM version 6.4.1

[float]
==== Bug Fixes
Changes introduced in 6.4.0 potentially caused an empty APM Kibana UI.
This happened in case the APM Server was using an outdated configuration file, not configured to index events into separate indices.
To fix this, the APM Kibana UI now falls back to use `apm-*` as default indices to query.
Users can still leverage separate indices for queries by overriding the default values described in {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[Kibana APM settings].
