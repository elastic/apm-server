[float]
==== APM version 6.4.1

[float]
===== Bug Fixes
Changes introduced in 6.4.0 potentially caused an empty APM Kibana UI.
This happened in case the APM Server was using an outdated configuration file, not configured to index events into separate indices. 
To fix this, the APM Kibana UI now falls back to use `apm-*` as default indices to query.
Users can still leverage separate indices for queries by overriding the default values described in {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[Kibana APM settings].


[float]
==== APM version 6.4.0

[float]
===== Breaking changes

We previously split APM data into separate indices (transaction, span, error, etc.).
In 6.4 APM Kibana UI starts to leverage those separate indices for queries.

In case you only update Kibana but run an older version of APM Server you will not be able to see any APM data by default.
To fix this, use the {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[Kibana APM settings] to specify the location of the APM index:
["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
apm_oss.errorIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.spanIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.transactionIndices: apm-*
apm_oss.onboardingIndices: apm-*
------------------------------------------------------------

In case you are upgrading APM Server from an older version, you might need to refresh your APM index pattern for certain APM UI features to work.
Also ensure to add the new config options in `apm-server.yml` in case you keep your existing configuration file:
["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  indices:
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-sourcemap"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "sourcemap"
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-error-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "error"
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-transaction-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "transaction"
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-span-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "span"
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-metric-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "metric"
    - index: "apm-%{[beat.version]}-onboarding-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
      when.contains:
        processor.event: "onboarding"
