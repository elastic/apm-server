[[release-highlights-7.6.0]]
=== APM version 7.6.0

// tag::notable-v76-highlights[]
Experimental Jaeger integration::

Elastic APM now integrates with https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger], an open-source, distributed tracing system.
This integration allows users with an existing Jaeger setup to switch from the default Jaeger backend,
to ingesting data with Elastic's APM Server, storing data in {es}, and visualizing traces in the APM app.
Best of all, this can be done without any instrumentation changes in your application code.
+
See {apm-server-ref-v}/jaeger.html[Jaeger integration] for more information.

Experimental API Key authentication::

You can now secure the communication between APM Agents and APM Server with
{apm-server-ref-v}/api-key.html[API keys].
API keys are easy to create and manage, and provide finer authorization rules than secret tokens. 

SIEM integration::

There are two, brand-new integrations with Elastic SIEM:
+
HTTP data collected with Elastic APM is now available in the SIEM app,
enabling you to hunt for security threats with your APM data.
+
The SIEM Detections feature automatically searches for threats and creates signals when they are detected.
The SIEM app ships with four prebuilt rules, specifically for the APM use case: No User Agent, POST Request Declined, Unauthorized Method, and sqlmap User Agent.
+
See the {siem-guide}/siem-ui-overview.html[SIEM hosts UI] and {siem-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[SIEM prebuilt rules]
for more information on using the SIEM app.

Chained exceptions::

Sometimes, an exception can cause or be caused by another exception.
APM Agents and the APM app now support chained exceptions,
and you can visualize when this happens in the APM app!
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/chained-exceptions.png[Chained exceptions]

Deployment annotations::

The APM app now displays {apm-app-ref}/transactions.html[deployment annotations] on all transaction charts.
This feature automatically tags new deployments, so you can easily see if your deploy has increased response times
for an end-user, or if the memory/CPU footprint of your application has increased.
Being able to quickly identify bad deployments enables you to rollback and fix issues without causing costly outages.
+
Deployment annotations are automatically enabled, and appear when the `service.version` of your app changes.
+

Index configuration::

Index defaults can now be changed in Kibana.
If you use custom index names for your APM data, this feature makes it very easy to update the indices that the APM app queries.
Simply navigate to *APM > Settings > Indices*, and make your changes!
Index settings in the APM app take precedence over those set in kibana.yml.

Java Agent support for Kafka and JMS::

The Java Agent now supports Kafka and JMS,
enabling you to visualize end to end traces that include the messaging service used to communicate between services.
In addition, you can now see the time your request spent waiting in the queue.

[[release-highlights-7.5.0]]
=== APM version 7.5.0

// tag::notable-v75-highlights[]

IMPORTANT: To make use of all the new features introduced in 7.5,
you must ensure you are using version 7.5+ of APM Server and version 7.5+ of Kibana.

*APM app in Kibana*

* {kibana-ref}/transactions.html[Aggregate Service Breakdown Charts] is GA.
Visualize where your applications and services are spending most of their
time, and find the root cause of a performance problem quickly.

image::images/breakdown-release-notes.png[Aggregate Service Breakdown Charts]

* {kibana-ref}/agent-configuration.html[APM Agent remote configuration] is GA.
View and edit certain configurations directly in Kibana without having to restart your Agents.
In 7.5, we're introducing two additional configurations:

** `TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` - Limit the number of spans recorded per transaction.

In addition, Agent remote configuration now supports all services and environments.
This means you can configure multiple services and environments in just one setting.

[[release-highlights-7.3.0]]
=== APM version 7.3.0

// tag::notable-v73-highlights[]

[discrete]
==== Elastic APM .NET Agent GA

https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-dotnet/[Elastic APM agent for .NET] is now
generally available! The .NET Agent adds automatic instrumentation for ASP.NET
Core 2.x+ and Entity Framework Core 2.x+, while also providing a
{apm-dotnet-ref}/public-api.html[Public API] for the .NET agent that will allow
you to instrument any .NET custom application code.

[discrete]
==== Aggregate service breakdown charts

beta[] In addition to the transaction duration and throughput charts, the 7.3
release adds aggregated service breakdown charts for services. These charts help
you visualize where your application and services are spending most of their
time, allowing you to get to the root cause of a performance problem quickly.
These charts are available in Beta with support for certain APM agents:

* Java added[1.8.0]
* Go added[1.5.0]
* Node.js added[2.13.0]
* Python added[5.0.0]

==== Agent sample rate configuration from APM UI

beta[] Configuring sampling rate for your services is a whole lot easier with this
release. The new settings page now lets you view and configure the sampling rate
for your services from within the APM UI without restarting them. To learn more
about this configuration, see
{kibana-ref}/agent-configuration.html[APM Agent configuration].

==== React support for Single Page Applications 

The 7.3 release also brings a lot of exciting changes to the Real User
Monitoring (RUM) agent. We have furthered our support of Single Page
Applications (SPA). You can now use the RUM agent to instrument your SPA written
in React.js without the need to manually create or rename transactions. For
more information, see {apm-rum-ref}/react-integration.html[React integration].

[discrete]
===== APM RUM integration with Elastic Maps

This release also makes both the geo-ip and user-agent modules enabled by
default, which makes it easier for you to integrate with
https://www.elastic.co/products/maps[Maps] so you can better understand the
performance of your RUM applications.

[[release-highlights-7.2.0]]
=== APM version 7.2.0

[float]
==== New features

*APM Server*

* Added support for {apm-server-ref-v}/ilm.html[index lifecycle management (ILM)]:
ILM enables you to automate how you want to manage your indices over time,
by automating rollovers to a new index when the existing index reaches a specified size or age.
* Added {ref}/geoip-processor.html[Geo-IP] processing to the default ingest pipeline:
Pipelines are still disabled by default, but activation now includes a new Geo-IP pipeline.
The Geo-IP pipeline takes an extracted IP address from RUM events and stores it in the `client.geo` field.
This makes it much easier to use location data in Kibana's Visualize maps and Maps app directly:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-geo-data.png[Kibana maps app]

*APM UI*

* APM + Uptime integration: APM transactions now include links to the Uptime UI when data is available.
* Added a global filter for {kibana-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[service environments]:
You can now easily name and switch between environments in the APM UI.
* Added support for {kibana-ref}/metrics.html[agent specific metrics]:
Java is the first to get custom metrics in the APM UI, with more agents to follow.

[[release-notes-6.4.1]]
=== APM version 6.4.1

[float]
==== Bug Fixes
Changes introduced in 6.4.0 potentially caused an empty APM Kibana UI.
This happened in case the APM Server was using an outdated configuration file, not configured to index events into separate indices. 
To fix this, the APM Kibana UI now falls back to use `apm-*` as default indices to query.
Users can still leverage separate indices for queries by overriding the default values described in {kibana-ref}/apm-settings-kb.html[Kibana APM settings].
