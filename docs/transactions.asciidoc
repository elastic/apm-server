== Transactions

A transaction represents one event, captured by an Elastic APM agent within one service. 
It is identified by a unique ID.
A transaction can for example be a single HTTP request or an asynchrounous background job within one service.

Several spans can be related to a transaction. 
The relationship is indicated by a `transaction.id`.

A span contains information about a specific code path, 
executed as part of a transaction. 
Every span is identified by an unique ID per transaction.

Elastic APM agents automatically instrument a variety of libraries, 
but also support custom instrumentation for code paths.

Every code path that is captured by an agent creates a span.

Transactions and spans are stored in separated indices by default. 
Read more about their representation in <<exploring-es-data, Elasticsearch>>.
