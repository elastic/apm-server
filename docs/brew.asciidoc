=== Install APM Server on macOS with Homebrew

Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install the Elastic Stack, including APM Server, with the
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the
Elastic Homebrew repository:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
brew tap elastic/tap
-------------------------

Once you've tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use `brew install` to
install the default distribution of APM Server:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
brew install elastic/tap/apm-server-full
-------------------------

This installs the most recently released default distribution of APM Server.
To install the OSS distribution, specify `elastic/tap/apm-server-oss`.
