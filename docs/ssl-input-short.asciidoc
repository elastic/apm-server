To enable SSL/TLS, you need to enable SSL and provide both a private key and a certificate
issued by a certificate authority (CA).
You can then specify the path to those files in your configuration properties.
This will make APM Server serve HTTPS requests instead of HTTP.

Here's a basic APM Server SSL config with secure communication enabled:

[source,yaml]
----
apm-server.ssl.enabled: true
apm-server.ssl.key: "/etc/pki/key.pem"
apm-server.ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/apm-server.pem"
----

A full list of configuration options is available in <<agent-server-ssl>>.
