=== Upgrade APM

// Starting in version 7.14, there are two methods of running Elastic APM.
// Determine which method you're running, then use the links below to find the correct upgrading guide.

// * Standalone (legacy): This mode has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
// Users on standalone mode run the APM Server binary to collect, parse, and send data to the {stack}.
// * {fleet} + APM integration: Users in this mode run {fleet} and the APM integration.

// There may be newly added configuration options, and you'll want to be aware of their default settings.
// See <<configuring-howto-apm-server,configuring>> for more information on available options.

// . If you set up index patterns and dashboards manually by running `./apm-server setup`,
// rerun the command to update the index pattern and the dashboards.
