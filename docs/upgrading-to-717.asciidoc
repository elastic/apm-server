=== Upgrade APM

Starting in version 7.14, there are two ways to run Elastic APM.
Determine which method you're using, then use the links below to find the correct upgrading guide.

* **Standalone (legacy)**: Users in this mode run and configure the APM Server binary.
This mode has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* **{fleet} and the APM integration**: Users in this mode run and configure {fleet} and the Elastic APM integration.

==== Upgrade a self-installation of APM Server standalone to {version}

++++
<titleabbrev>Self-installation standalone (legacy)</titleabbrev>
++++

This upgrade guide is for the standalone (legacy) method of running APM Server.
Only use this guide if both of the following are true:

* You have a self-installation of the {stack}, i.e. you're not using {ecloud}.
* You're running the APM Server binary, i.e. you haven't switched to the Elastic APM integration.

==== Prerequisites

Review the APM <<release-notes,release notes>>, <<apm-breaking,breaking changes>>,
and Observability {observability-guide}/whats-new.html[What's new] content.

==== Upgrade steps

. **Upgrade the {stack} to version {version}**
+
The {stack} ({es} and {kib}) must be upgraded before APM Server.
See the {stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[{stack} Installation and Upgrade Guide] for guidance.

. **Install the {version} APM Server release**
+
See <<installing,install>> to find the command that works with your system.

. **Review your configuration file**
+
Some settings may have been removed or changed, so you may need to update your `apm-server.yml` configuration
file prior to starting the APM Server.
See <<directory-layout>> for help in locating this file,
and <<configuring-howto-apm-server>> for a list of all available configuration options.

. **(Optional) Update custom index patterns and dashboards**
+
If you set up custom index patterns or dashboards,
rerun the setup command to update your new installation of APM Server.
+
[source,bash]
----
./apm-server setup
----

. **Start the APM Server**
+
When you start the APM Server after upgrading, it creates new indices that use the current version,
and applies the correct index template automatically.
To start the APM Server, run:
+
[source,bash]
----
./apm-server -e
----
+
Additional details are available in <<apm-server-starting,start the APM Server>>.

. **(Optional) Upgrade to the APM integration**
+
