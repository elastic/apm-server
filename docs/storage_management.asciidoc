Storage management is a large topic.
In the following we focus on how you can <<reduce-storage, reduce storage>> by deleting data 
or trimming data collection already during ingestion time. 

We also cover how you can <<update-existing-data, update data>> once they are stored.

[[reduce-storage]]
== Reduce storage
The amount of storage for APM data depends on several factors. 
Depending on how many services you are instrumenting and how much traffic the services see, 
the number of recorded transactions varies.
You can influence the detail level of the information collected 
by reducing the sample rate or reducing collected stacktrace information.
Another factor is for how long you want to keep monitoring data around.

[[reduce-sample-rate]]
[float]
=== Reduce the sample rate
In case you are monitoring high traffic services you might want to decrease the number of transactions that are sampled. 
The transaction sample rate directly influences the number of documents to be indexed
and therefore is the most obvious way to reduce storage. 

The transaction sample rate is controlled in the configuration of agents (for example for {apm-py-ref}/configuration.html#config-transaction-sample-rate[Python] and {apm-node-ref}/agent-api.html#transaction-sample-rate[Node.js]).

Reducing the transaction sample rate does not affect the collection of metrics such as _Transactions Per Second_.

[[reduce-stacktrace]]
[float]
=== Reduce collected stacktrace information
Elastic APM agents automatically collect information regarding stacktraces under certain circumstances. 
This can be very helpful by identifying issues in your code,
but it also comes with an overhead at collection time 
and increaeses the storage usage. 
If you want to decrease collected stacktrace information you have to configure this directly in the agents. 
Please refer to our {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[agent documentation] to read more about the options in the single 
agents. 

[[delete-data]]
[float]
=== Delete data
You might want to delete data for several reasons.
A common use case is to keep data only for a defined time period and delete older documents. 
You might also want to delete data collected for specific services or customers. 
Depending on your use case, 
you can either delete data periodically with a tool like {curator-ref-current}[Curator] 
or by using the {ref}/docs-delete-by-query.html[Delete By Query API].


[[delete-data-periodically]]
[float]
==== Delete data periodically

It might make sense to delete old APM indices on a periodic basis to make room for new data. 
To do this you can use a tool like {curator-ref-current}[Curator] and set up a cron job to run it periodically.

By default APM indices have the pattern `apm-%{[beat.version]}-{type}-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}`.
With the curator command line interface you can, for instance, see all your existing indices:

["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
curator_cli --host localhost show_indices --filter_list '[\{"filtertype":"pattern","kind":"prefix","value":"apm-"\}]'

apm-{stack-version}-error-{sample_date_0}
apm-{stack-version}-error-{sample_date_1}
apm-{stack-version}-error-{sample_date_2}
apm-{stack-version}-sourcemap
apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_0}
apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_1}
apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_2}
apm-{stack-version}-transaction-{sample_date_0}
apm-{stack-version}-transaction-{sample_date_1}
apm-{stack-version}-transaction-{sample_date_2}
------------------------------------------------------------

And then delete any span indices older than 1 day:

["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
curator_cli --host localhost delete_indices --filter_list '[\{"filtertype":"pattern","kind":"prefix","value":"apm-{stack-version}-span-"\}, \{"filtertype":"age","source":"name","timestring":"%Y.%m.%d","unit":"days","unit_count":1,"direction":"older"\}]'

INFO      Deleting selected indices: [apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_0}, apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_1}]
INFO      ---deleting index apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_0}
INFO      ---deleting index apm-{stack-version}-span-{sample_date_1}
INFO      "delete_indices" action completed.
------------------------------------------------------------


[[delete-data-by-query]]
[float]
==== Delete data matching a query

In case you want to delete documents matching a specific query, e.g. all documents with a given `context.service.name`,
you can do this by sending the following request:

["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
POST /apm-*/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "term": {
            "context.service.name": {
              "value": "old-service-name"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

See {ref}/docs-delete-by-query.html[delete by query] for further information on this topic.

[[update-existing-data]]
== Update existing data
You might want to update documents already ingested to Elasticsearch, 
e.g. if you your service name was set incorrectly, 
or you need to update a tag you have set.

You can update existing data by using the {ref}/docs-update-by-query.html[Update By Query API].

[[update-data-rename-a-service]]
[float]
=== Rename a service
For exampe, 
if you want to change the service name reported for your monitored data,
you can do that by sending the following request:

["source","sh"]
------------------------------------------------------------
POST /apm-*/_update_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "context.service.name": {
        "value": "old-service-name"
      }
    }
  },
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.context.service.name = 'new-service-name'",
    "lang": "painless"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Also check out how to change the service name for newly collected documents in the {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[APM agent configuration] accordingly.
