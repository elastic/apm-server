=== Security

APM Server exposes a HTTP endpoint and as with anything that opens ports on your servers, you should be careful about who can connect to it.
We recommend using firewall rules to ensure only authorized systems can connect.

There is also the option of setting up TLS to ensure data sent to the APM Server is encrypted.
