There are two methods to monitor the APM Server binary.
Make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster,
then configure one of these methods to collect {beatname_uc} metrics:

* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>> - Internal
collectors send monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.
ifndef::serverless[]
* <<monitoring-metricbeat-collection, {metricbeat} collection>> -
{metricbeat} collects monitoring data from your {beatname_uc} instance
and sends it directly to your monitoring cluster.
endif::[]

include::monitoring-internal-collection.asciidoc[]

ifndef::serverless[]
include::monitoring-metricbeat.asciidoc[]
endif::[]
