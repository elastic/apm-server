[[add-apm-server-instances]]
[float]
==== Add APM Server instances

If the APM Server cannot process data quickly enough,
you will see request timeouts.

One way to solve this problem is to increase processing power.
This can be done by either migrating your APM Server to a more powerful machine
or adding more APM Server instances.
Having several instances will also increase <<high-availability, availability>>.

[[reduce-payload-size]]
[float]
==== Reduce the payload size

Large payloads may result in request timeouts.
You can reduce the payload size by decreasing the flush interval in the agents.
This will cause agents to send smaller and more frequent requests.

Optionally you can also <<reduce-sample-rate, reduce the sample rate>> or <<reduce-stacktrace, reduce the amount of stack traces>>.

Read more in the {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[agents documentation].

[[adjust-event-rate]]
[float]
==== Adjust anonymous auth rate limit

Agents make use of long running requests and flush as many events over a single request as possible.
Thus, the rate limiter for anonymous authentication is bound to the number of _events_ sent per second, per IP.

If the event rate limit is hit while events on an established request are sent, the request is not immediately terminated. The intake of events is only throttled to <<config-auth-anon-event-limit,`rate_limit.event_limit`>>, which means that events are queued and processed slower. Only when the allowed buffer queue is also full, does the request get terminated with a `429 - rate limit exceeded` HTTP response. If an agent tries to establish a new request, but the rate limit is already hit, a `429` will be sent immediately.

Increasing the <<config-auth-anon-event-limit,`rate_limit.event_limit`>> default value will help avoid `rate limit exceeded` errors.
