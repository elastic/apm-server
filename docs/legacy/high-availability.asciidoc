=== High Availability

To achieve high availability
you can place multiple instances of APM Server behind a regular HTTP load balancer,
for example HAProxy or nginx.

The endpoint `/` always returns an `HTTP 200`.
You can configure your load balancer to send HTTP requests to this endpoint
to determine if an APM Server is running.
See <<server-info>> for more information on that endpoint.

In case of temporal issues, like unavailable Elasticsearch or a sudden high workload,
the data is buffered in an internal memory queue and ingestion retried.

If a given APM Server process fails,
the data that has not yet been forwarded to Elasticsearch is lost.
