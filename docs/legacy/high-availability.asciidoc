=== High Availability

IMPORTANT: {deprecation-notice-installation}

To achieve high availability
you can place multiple instances of APM Server behind a regular HTTP load balancer,
for example HAProxy or Nginx.

The endpoint `/` always returns an `HTTP 200`.
You can configure your load balancer to send HTTP requests to this endpoint
to determine if an APM Server is running.
See <<server-info>> for more information on that endpoint.

In case of temporal issues, like unavailable {es} or a sudden high workload,
APM Server does not have an internal queue to buffer requests,
but instead leverages an HTTP request timeout to act as back-pressure.

If {es} goes down, the APM Server will eventually deny incoming requests.
Both the APM Server and {apm-agent}(s) will issue logs accordingly.
