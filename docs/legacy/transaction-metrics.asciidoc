IMPORTANT: {deprecation-notice-config}

{beatname_uc} produces transaction histogram metrics that are used to power the {apm-app}.
Shifting this responsibility from {apm-app} to APM Server removes the need to store unsampled transactions, reducing storage costs.

Example config file:

["source","yaml"]
----
apm-server:
  aggregation:
    transactions:
      interval: 1m

=== Configuration options: `apm-server.aggregation.transactions.*`

[[transactions-interval]]
[float]
==== `interval`

Controls the frequency of metrics publication.

Default: `1m`.

[[transactions-max_groups]]
[float]
==== `max_groups`

Maximum number of transaction groups to keep track of.
Once exceeded, APM Server devolves into recording a metrics document for each transaction that is not in one
of the transaction groups being tracked.

Default: `10000`.

[[transactions-hdrhistogram_significant_figures]]
[float]
==== `hdrhistogram_significant_figures`

The fixed, worst-case percentage error (specified as a number of significant digits)
to maintain for recorded metrics.
Supported values are `1` through `5`.
See {ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html#_hdr_histogram_2[HDR histogram] for more information.

Default: `2`.
