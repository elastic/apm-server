If you're just looking for a quick way to try out Elastic APM, you can easily get started with Docker.
Just follow the steps below.

**Create a docker-compose.yml file**

The https://www.docker.elastic.co/[Elastic Docker registry] contains Docker images for all of the products
in the {stack}.
You can use Docker compose to easily get the default distributions of {es}, {kib},
and APM Server up and running in Docker.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and copy and paste in the following:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
include::./docker-compose.yml[]
--------------------------------------------

**Compose**

Run `docker-compose up`.
Compose will download the official docker containers and start {es}, {kib}, and APM Server.

**Install Agents**

When Compose finishes, navigate to http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/home/tutorial/apm.
Complete steps 4-6 to configure your application to collect and report APM data.

**Visualize**

Use the APM app at http://localhost:5601/app/apm to visualize your application performance data!

When you're done, `ctrl+c` will stop all of the containers.

**Advanced Docker usage**

If you're interested in learning more about all of the APM features available,
or running the Elastic stack on Docker in a production environment, see the following documentation:
