// === Terminology

// Agents::

// {agent} and APM agents are different components:
// +
// {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[**{agent}**] is a single,
// unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to collect data and send it to the {stack}.
// Behind the scenes, {agent} runs APM Server to listen for `apm` data.
// +
// {apm-overview-ref-v}/components.html[**APM agents**] are open source libraries written in the same language as your service.
// You may only need one, or you might use all of them.
// You install them into your service as you would install any other library.
// They instrument your code and collect performance data and errors at runtime.
// This data is sent to APM Server.

// Central management/configuration::

// // to do: add links to these docs
// Fleet central management and APM agent central configuration are two different features
// that can be accessed in {kib}:
// +
// **Fleet central management** serves as the communication channel with your {agent}s;
// agents check in for the latest updates on a regular basis.
// +
// **APM agent central configuration** allows you to fine-tune your agent configuration from within the APM app.
// Changes are automatically propagated to your APM agents, so thereâ€™s no need to redeploy your services.
