=== Real User Monitoring (RUM)
Real User Monitoring captures user interaction with clients such as web browsers.
The {apm-rum-ref-v}[JavaScript Agent] is Elasticâ€™s RUM Agent.
To use it you need to {apm-server-ref-v}/configuration-rum.html[enable RUM support] in the APM Server.

Unlike Elastic APM backend agents which monitor requests and responses,
the RUM JavaScript agent monitors the real user experience and interaction within your client-side application.
The RUM JavaScript agent is also framework-agnostic, which means it can be used with any frontend JavaScript application.

You will be able to measure metrics such as "Time to First Byte", `domInteractive`,
and `domComplete` which helps you discover performance issues within your client-side application as well as issues that relate to the latency of your server-side application.
