=== OpenTelemetry integration

{ot-what}[OpenTelemetry] is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of
telemetry data from your services and applications. For more information about the
OpenTelemetry project, see the {ot-spec}[spec].

Elastic integrates with OpenTelemetry, allowing you to reuse your existing instrumentation
to easily send observability data to the {stack}.
