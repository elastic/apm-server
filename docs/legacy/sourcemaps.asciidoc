Minifying JavaScript bundles in production is a common practice;
it can greatly improve the load time and network latency of your applications.
The problem with minifying code is that it can be hard to debug.

For best results, uploading source maps should become a part of your deployment procedure,
and not something you only do when you see unhelpful errors.
That's because uploading source maps after errors happen won't make old errors magically readable —
errors must occur again for source mapping to occur.

Here's an example of an exception stack trace in the {apm-app} when using minified code.
As you can see, it's not very helpful.

With a source map, minified files are mapped back to the original source code,
allowing you to maintain the speed advantage of minified code,
without losing the ability to quickly and easily debug your application.
Here's the same example as before, but with a source map uploaded and applied:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/source-map-after.png[{apm-app} with source mapping]

Follow the steps below to enable source mapping your error stack traces in the {apm-app}:

* <<sourcemap-rum-initialize>>
* <<sourcemap-rum-generate>>
* <<sourcemap-rum-configure>>
* <<sourcemap-rum-upload>>

=== Initialize the RUM Agent

Set the service name and version of your application when initializing the RUM Agent.
To make uploading subsequent source maps easier, the `serviceVersion` you choose might be the
`version` from your `package.json`. For example:

[source,js]
----
import { init as initApm } from '@elastic/apm-rum'
const serviceVersion = require("./package.json").version

const apm = initApm({
  serviceName: 'myService',
  serviceVersion: serviceVersion
})
----

Or, `serviceVersion` could be a git commit reference. For example:

[source,js]
----
const git = require('git-rev-sync')
const serviceVersion = git.short()
----

It can also be any other unique string that indicates a specific version of your application.
The APM integration uses the service name and version to match the correct source map file to each stack trace.

=== Generate a source map

To be compatible with Elastic APM, source maps must follow the
https://sourcemaps.info/spec.html[source map revision 3 proposal spec].

Source maps can be generated and configured in many different ways.
For example, parcel automatically generates source maps by default.
If you're using webpack, some configuration may be needed to generate a source map:

[source,js]
----
const webpack = require('webpack')
const serviceVersion = require("./package.json").version <1>
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  entry: 'app.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'app.min.js',
    path: './dist'
  },
  devtool: 'source-map',
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({'serviceVersion': JSON.stringify(serviceVersion)}),
    new TerserPlugin({
      sourceMap: true
    })
  ]
}
----
<1> If you're using a different method of defining `serviceVersion`, you can set it here.

=== Configure the {kib} endpoint in APM Server

include::./tab-widgets/kibana-endpoint-widget.asciidoc[]

[float]
[[sourcemap-rum-upload]]
=== Upload the source map to {kib}

{kib} exposes a {kibana-ref}/rum-sourcemap-api.html[source map endpoint] for uploading source maps.
Source maps can be uploaded as a string, or as a file upload.

Let's look at two different ways to upload a source map: curl and a custom application.
Each example includes the four fields necessary for APM Server to later map minified code to its source:

* `service_name` - Should match the `serviceName` from step one
* `service_version` - Should match the `serviceVersion` from step one
* `bundle_filepath` - The absolute path of the final bundle as used in the web application
* `sourcemap` - The location of the source map.
If you have multiple source maps, you'll need to upload each individually.

[float]
[[sourcemap-curl]]
==== Upload via curl

Here’s an example curl request that uploads the source map file created in the previous step.
This request uses an API key for authentication.

[source,console]
----
SERVICEVERSION=`node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').version);"` && \ <1>
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5601/api/apm/sourcemaps" \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-H 'kbn-xsrf: true' \
-H 'Authorization: ApiKey ${YOUR_API_KEY}' \ <2>
-F 'service_name="foo"' \
-F 'service_version="$SERVICEVERSION"' \
-F 'bundle_filepath="/test/e2e/general-usecase/bundle.js.map"' \
-F 'sourcemap="@./dist/app.min.js.map"'
----
<1> This example uses the version from `package.json`
<2> The API key used here needs to have appropriate {kibana-ref}/rum-sourcemap-api.html[privileges]

[float]
[[sourcemap-custom-app]]
==== Upload via a custom app

To ensure uploading source maps become a part of your deployment process,
consider automating the process with a custom application.
Here's an example Node.js application that uploads the source map file created in the previous step:

[source,js]
----
console.log('Uploading sourcemaps!')
var request = require('request')
var filepath = './dist/app.min.js.map'
var formData = {
  headers: {
    Content-Type: 'multipart/form-data',
    kbn-xsrf: 'true',
    Authorization: 'ApiKey ${YOUR_API_KEY}'
  },
  service_name: 'service-name’,
  service_version: require("./package.json").version, // Or use 'git-rev-sync' for git commit hash
  bundle_filepath: 'http://localhost/app.min.js',
  sourcemap: fs.createReadStream(filepath)
}
request.post({url: 'http://localhost:5601/api/apm/sourcemaps',formData: formData}, function (err, resp, body) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error while uploading sourcemaps!', err)
  } else {
    console.log('Sourcemaps uploaded!')
  }
})
----

That's it! New exception stack traces should now be correctly mapped to your source code.
Don't forget to enable RUM support in the APM integration if you haven't already.
