[[configuration-process]]
== General configuration options

IMPORTANT: {deprecation-notice-config}
If you've already upgraded, please see <<input-apm>> instead.

Example config file:

["source","yaml"]
----
apm-server:
  host: "localhost:8200"
  rum:
    enabled: true

output:
  elasticsearch:
    hosts: ElasticsearchAddress:9200

max_procs: 4
----

NOTE: If you are using an X-Pack secured version of {stack},
you need to specify credentials in the config file before you run the commands that set up and start APM Server.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["ElasticsearchAddress:9200"]
  username: "elastic"
  password: "elastic"
----

[[configuration-apm-server]]
=== Configuration options: `apm-server.*`

[[host]]
[float]

Defaults to 'localhost:8200'.

[[max_header_size]]
[float]
==== `max_header_size`

Defaults to 1048576 Bytes (1 MB).

[[idle_timeout]]
[float]
==== `idle_timeout`
Maximum amount of time to wait for the next incoming request before underlying connection is closed.
Defaults to 45 seconds.

[[read_timeout]]
[float]
==== `read_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for reading an entire request.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[write_timeout]]
[float]
==== `write_timeout`
Maximum permitted duration for writing a response.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

[[shutdown_timeout]]
[float]
==== `shutdown_timeout`
Maximum duration in seconds before releasing resources when shutting down the server.
Defaults to 5 seconds.

[[max_event_size]]

[float]
[[configuration-other]]
=== Configuration options: general

[[max_connections]]
[float]
==== `max_connections`
Maximum number of TCP connections to accept simultaneously.
Default value is 0, which means _unlimited_.

[[config-secret-token]]
[float]
==== `auth.secret_token`
Authorization token for sending data to the APM server.
If a token is set, the agents must send it in the following format:
Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.
The token is not used for RUM endpoints. By default, no authorization token is set.

It is recommended to use an authorization token in combination with SSL enabled.
Read more about <<securing-apm-server, Securing APM Server>> and the <<secret-token-legacy, secret token>>.

[[config-secret-token-legacy]]
[float]
==== `secret_token`

deprecated::[7.14.0, Replaced by `auth.secret_token`. See <<config-secret-token>>]

In versions prior to 7.14.0, secret token authorization was known as `apm-server.secret_token`. In 7.14.0 this was renamed `apm-server.auth.secret_token`.
The old configuration will continue to work until 8.0.0, and the new configuration will take precedence.

If true,
APM Server captures the IP of the instrumented service and its User Agent if any.
