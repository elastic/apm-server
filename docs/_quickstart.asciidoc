== Quick start with {ecloud}

The easiest way to get started with Elastic APM is by using our
{ess-product}[hosted {es} Service] on {ecloud}.
The {es} Service is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
The {es} Service provisions the following components of the {stack}:

* *{es}* -- A highly scalable free and open full-text search and analytics engine.
* *{kib}* -- An analytics and visualization platform designed to work with {es}.
* *Integrations Server* -- A combined *APM Server* and *Fleet-managed {agent}*.
** *APM Server* -- An application that receives, processes, and validates performance data from your APM agents.
** *Fleet-managed {agent}* -- A server that runs APM Server and provides a control plane for easily configuring and updating APM Server and other integrations.

Don't worry--in order to get started,
you don't need to understand how all of these pieces work together!
When you use our hosted {es} Service,
simply spin-up your instance and point your *APM agents* towards it.
