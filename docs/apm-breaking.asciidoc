This section describes the breaking changes and deprecations introduced in this release
and previous minor versions.

[float]
[[breaking-changes-8.2]]
=== 8.2

// tag::82-bc[]
The following breaking changes are introduced in APM version 8.2.0:

[float]
==== APM Server now emits events with `event.duration`

APM Server no longer emits events with a `transaction.duration.us` or `span.duration.us`.
Instead, events are emitted with an `event.duration`.
An ingest pipeline sets the legacy `<event>.duration.us` field and removes the `event.duration`.

This change will impact users who are not using APM Server's {es} output or the packaged ingest pipeline.
For details, see https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/7261[PR #7261].

[float]
==== Removed `observer.version_major`

The field `observer.version_major` is non-standard and existed only for the APM UI to filter out legacy docs (versions <7.0).
This check is no longer performed, so the field has been removed.

For details, see https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/7399[PR #7399].

[float]
==== APM Server no longer ships with System V init scripts or the go-daemon wrapper

As of version 8.1.0, all Linux distributions supported by APM Server support systemd.
As a result, APM Server no longer ships with System V init scripts or the go-daemon wrapper; use systemd instead.

For details, see https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/pull/7576[PR #7576].

[float]
==== Deprecated 32-bit architectures

APM Server support for 32-bit architectures has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
// end::82-bc[]

[float]
[[breaking-changes-8.1]]
=== 8.1

// tag::81-bc[]
There are no breaking changes in APM.
// end::81-bc[]

[float]
[[breaking-changes-8.0]]
=== 8.0

// tag::80-bc[]
The following breaking changes are introduced in APM version 8.0.

[float]
==== Indices are now manged by {fleet}

All index management has been removed from APM Server;
{fleet} is now entirely responsible for setting up index templates, index lifecycle polices,
and index pipelines.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.ilm.*`
* `apm-server.register.ingest.pipeline.*`
* `setup.*`

[float]
==== Data streams by default

APM Server now only writes to well-defined data streams;
writing to classic indices is no longer supported.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.data_streams.enabled`
* `output.elasticsearch.index`
* `output.elasticsearch.indices`
* `output.elasticsearch.pipeline`
* `output.elasticsearch.pipelines`

[float]
==== New {es} output

APM Server has a new {es} output implementation with defaults that should be sufficient for
most use cases; it should no longer be necessary to manually tune the output
of APM Server.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size`
* `output.elasticsearch.worker`
* `queue.*`

[float]
==== New source map upload endpoint

The source map upload endpoint has been removed from APM Server.
Source maps should now be uploaded directly to {kib} instead.

[float]
==== Legacy Jaeger endpoints have been removed

The legacy Jaeger gRPC and HTTP endpoints have been removed from APM Server.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.jaeger`

[float]
==== Homebrew no longer supported

APM Server no longer supports installation via Homebrew.
