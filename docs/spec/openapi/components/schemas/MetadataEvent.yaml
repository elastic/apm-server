description: >
  Every new connection to the APM Server starts with a metadata stanza. This
  provides general metadata concerning the other objects in the stream. Rather
  than send this metadata information from the agent multiple times, the APM
  Server hangs on to this information and applies it to other objects in the
  stream as necessary. TIP: Metadata is stored under context when viewing
  documents in Elasticsearch. APM agents automatically read Kubernetes data and
  send it to the APM Server. In most instances, agents are able to read this
  data from inside the container. If this is not the case, or if you wish to
  override this data, you can set environment variables for the agents to read.
  These environment variable are set via the Kubernetes Downward API.
