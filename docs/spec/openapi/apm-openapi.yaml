      The OpenTelemetry intake API uses the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to send traces, metrics, and logs to APM Server.
      OTLP is the default transfer protocol for OpenTelemetry and is supported natively by APM Server.
      APM Server supports two OTLP communication protocols on the same port: OTLP/HTTP (protobuf) and OTLP/gRPC.

  /intake/v2/events:
    post:
      summary: Send APM agent events
      description: |
        NOTE: Most users do not need to interact directly with the events intake API. Agents communicate with the APM Server by sending events--captured pieces of information--in an HTTP request. Events can be transactions, spans, errors, or metrics. Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP request body, which is known as newline delimited JSON (NDJSON). With NDJSON, agents can open an HTTP POST request and use chunked encoding to stream events to the APM Server as soon as they are recorded in the agent. This makes it simple for agents to serialize each event to a stream of newline delimited JSON. The APM Server also treats the HTTP body as a compressed stream and thus reads and handles each event independently. See the [APM data model](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-data-model.html) to learn more about the different types of events.

            Indicates whether to use asynchronous processing, which is supported by APM Server in 8.5.0 and later. NOTE: Since asynchronous processing defers some of the event processing to the background and takes place after the client has closed the request, some errors can't be communicated back to the client and are logged by the APM Server. Furthermore, asynchronous processing requests will only be scheduled if the APM Server can service the incoming request; requests that cannot be serviced will receive an internal error 503 "queue is full" error.

        TIP: Metadata is stored under context when viewing documents in Elasticsearch.
        APM agents automatically read Kubernetes data and send it to the APM Server.
        In most instances, agents are able to read this data from inside the container.
        If this is not the case, or if you wish to override this data, you can set environment variables for the agents to read.
