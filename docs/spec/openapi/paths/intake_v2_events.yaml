  summary: Send APM agent events
  description: >
    NOTE: Most users do not need to interact directly with the events intake
    API. Agents communicate with the APM Server by sending events--captured
    pieces of information--in an HTTP request. Events can be transactions,
    spans, errors, or metrics. Each event is sent as its own line in the HTTP
    request body, which is known as newline delimited JSON (NDJSON). With
    NDJSON, agents can open an HTTP POST request and use chunked encoding to
    stream events to the APM Server as soon as they are recorded in the agent.
    This makes it simple for agents to serialize each event to a stream of
    newline delimited JSON. The APM Server also treats the HTTP body as a
    compressed stream and thus reads and handles each event independently. See
    the [APM data
    model](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-data-model.html)
    to learn more about the different types of events.
