When an <<api-key,API key>> or <<secret-token,secret token>> is configured,
anonymous authentication must be enabled to collect RUM data.
Set **Anonymous Agent access** to true to enable anonymous authentication.

When configuring anonymous authentication for client-side services,
there are a few configuration variables that can mitigate the impact of malicious requests to an
unauthenticated APM Server endpoint.

Use the **Allowed anonymous agents** and **Allowed anonymous services** configs to ensure that the
`agent.name` and `service.name` of each incoming request match a specified list.

Additionally, the APM Server can rate-limit unauthenticated requests based on the client IP address
(`client.ip`) of the request.
This allows you to specify the maximum number of requests allowed per unique IP address, per second.

When an <<api-key,API key>> or <<secret-token,secret token>> is configured,
anonymous authentication must be enabled to collect RUM data.
To enable anonymous access, set either <<rum-enable,`apm-server.rum.enabled`>> or
<<config-auth-anon-enabled,`apm-server.auth.anonymous.enabled`>> to `true`.

Because anyone can send anonymous events to the APM Server,
additional configuration variables are available to rate limit the number anonymous events the APM Server processes;
throughput is equal to the `rate_limit.ip_limit` times the `rate_limit.event_limit`.

See <<configuration-anonymous>> for a complete list of options and a sample configuration file.
