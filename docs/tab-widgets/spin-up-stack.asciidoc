There's no faster way to get started with Elastic APM than with our hosted {ess} on Elastic Cloud
{ess} is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure,
and automatically configures APM Server to work with {es} and {kib}:

. {ess-trial}[Get a free trial].

. Log into {ess-console}[Elastic Cloud].

. Click *Create deployment*.

. Select *Elastic Observability* and give your deployment a name.

. Click *Create deployment* and copy the password for the `elastic` user.

. Select *APM* from the menu on the left and make note of the APM endpoint and APM Server secret token.
You'll need these in step two.

// end::ess[]

// tag::self-managed[]
To install and run {es} and {kib}, see {stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[getting started with the {stack}].

Next, install, set up, and run APM Server:

. {apm-server-ref-v}/installing.html[Install APM Server].
. {apm-server-ref-v}/apm-server-configuration.html[Set up APM Server]
. {apm-server-ref-v}/setting-up-and-running.html[Start APM Server].

Use the config file if you need to change the default configuration that APM Server uses to connect to {es},
or if you need to specify credentials:

* {apm-server-ref-v}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[Configuring APM Server]
** {apm-server-ref-v}/configuration-process.html[General configuration options]
** {apm-server-ref-v}/elasticsearch-output.html[Configure the {es} output]

[[secure-api-access]]
If you change the listen address from `localhost` to something that is accessible from outside of the machine,
we recommend setting up firewall rules to ensure that only your own systems can access the API.
Alternatively,
you can use a {apm-server-ref-v}/securing-apm-server.html[TLS and a secret token or API key].

If you have APM Server running on the same host as your service,
you can configure it to listen on a Unix domain socket.

including details on how to run APM Server in a highly available environment,
please see the full {apm-server-ref-v}/index.html[APM Server documentation].
