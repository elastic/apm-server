If you're running APM Server in Elastic cloud, you can configure your own user settings right in the Elasticsearch Service Console.
Any changes are automatically appended to the `apm-server.yml` configuration file for your instance.

Full details are available in the {cloud}/ec-manage-apm-settings.html[APM user settings] documentation.
