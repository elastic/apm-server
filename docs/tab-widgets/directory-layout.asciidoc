For the ZIP, tar.gz, or TGZ distributions, these paths are based on the location
of the extracted binary file. This means that if you start {beatname_uc} with
the following simple command, all paths are set correctly:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./{beatname_lc}

For the deb and rpm distributions, these paths are set in the init script or in
the systemd unit file.  Make sure that you start the {beatname_uc} service by using
the preferred operating system method (init scripts or `systemctl`).
Otherwise the paths might be set incorrectly.
