TIP: APM Server version 7.0 introduces breaking changes with older versions of APM agents.
Check the {apm-overview-ref-v}/agent-server-compatibility.html[agent/server compatibility matrix] for compatibility information.

[[tune-output-config]]
[float]
=== Tune APM Server output parameters for your Elasticsearch cluster

If your Elasticsearch cluster is not ingesting the amount of data you expect,
you can tweak a few APM Server settings:

* Adjust `output.elasticsearch.worker`.
See {ref}/tune-for-indexing-speed.html[tune for indexing speed] for an overview.
* Ensure `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size` is set to a high value, for example 5120.
  The default of 50 is very conservative.
* Ensure that `queue.mem.events` is set to a reasonable value compared to your other settings.
A good rule of thumb is that `queue.mem.events` should equal `output.elasticsearch.worker` multiplied by `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size`.

The <<configuring-output,output configuration>> section shows more details.

[[adjust-queue-size]]
[float]
=== Adjust internal queue size

APM Server uses an internal queue to buffer incoming events.
A larger queue can retain more data if Elasticsearch is unavailable for longer periods,
and it alleviates problems that might result from sudden spikes of traffic.
You can adjust the queue size by overriding <<mem.events,`queue.mem.events`>>.
Increasing <<mem.events,`queue.mem.events`>> can significantly affect APM Server memory usage.

[[add-apm-server-instances]]
[float]
=== Add APM Server instances

If the APM Server cannot process data quickly enough,
you will see request timeouts.

One way to solve this problem is to increase processing power.
This can be done by either migrating your APM Server to a more powerful machine
or adding more APM Server instances.
Having several instances will also increase <<high-availability, availability>>.

[[reduce-payload-size]]
[float]
=== Reduce the payload size

Large payloads may result in request timeouts.
You can reduce the payload size by decreasing the flush interval in the agents.
This will cause agents to send smaller and more frequent requests.

Optionally you can also <<reduce-sample-rate, reduce the sample rate>> or <<reduce-stacktrace, reduce the amount of stacktraces>>.

Read more in the {apm-agents-ref}/index.html[agents documentation].

[[adjust-event-rate]]
[float]
=== Adjust RUM event rate limit

Agents make use of long running requests and flush as many events over a single request as possible. Thus, the rate limiter for RUM is bound to the number of _events_ sent per second, per IP. 

If the rate limit is hit while events on an established request are sent, the request is not immediately terminated. The intake of events is only throttled to <<event_rate.limit,`event_rate.limit`>>, which means that events are queued and processed slower. Only when the allowed buffer queue is also full, does the request get terminated with a `429 - rate limit exceeded` HTTP response. If an agent tries to establish a new request, but the rate limit is already hit, a `429` will be sent immediately.

Increasing the <<event_rate.limit,`event_rate.limit`>> default value will help avoid `rate limit exceeded` errors.
