== Errors

An error record represents one error event, captured by Elastic APM agents within one service. 
It is identified by a unique ID.

Some of the key attributes of an error are described in more detail:

=== Error
An error event contains at least
information about the original `exception` that occured 
or information about a `log` that was created when the exception occured. 

Both the captured `exception` and the captured `log` of an error can contain `stack trace` information,
helpful for debugging an error. 

The `culprit` of an error gives some information about the origin of the error. 

Errors also contain a `grouping_key` which can be used to group together identical or similar errors. 

An error can be mapped to the <<transactions,transaction>> during which it happened, 
via the `transaction.id`, indexed together with the error event.
