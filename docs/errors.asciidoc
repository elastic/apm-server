== Errors

An error record represents one error event, 
captured by Elastic APM agents within one service. 
It is identified by a unique ID.
An error event contains at least
information about the original `exception` that occured 
or information about a `log` that was created when the exception occured. 

Both the captured `exception` and the captured `log` of an error can contain `stack trace` information,
helpful for debugging an error. 

The `culprit` of an error gives some information about the origin of the error. 

An error can be mapped to the <<transactions,transaction>> during which it happened, 
via the `transaction.id`.
