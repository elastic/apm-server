== Errors

Errors are identified by a unique ID.
An error event contains at least
information about the original `exception` that occured
or about a `log` created when the exception occured.

Both the captured `exception` and the captured `log` of an error can contain a `stack trace`,
helpful for debugging.

The `culprit` of an error indicates where is originated.

An error might relate to the <<transactions,transaction>> during which it happened,
via the `transaction.id`.

Errors also have some contextual data.

Errors are stored in <<error-indices, error indices>>.
