== Errors

An error record represents one error event, captured by Elastic APM agents within one service. 
It is identified by a unique ID.
Errors contain information about the `exception` that has been captured
and some meta information about the setting in which the error occured. 

Errors can either relate to monitored <<transactions, transactions>> 
or be monitored stand alone, 
depending on how your APM agents are set up.

Read more about how an <<error-indices, error document>> is indexed in Elasticsearch and which information erorr documents hold.
