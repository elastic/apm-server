[[agent-server-ssl]]
=== SSL input settings

You can specify the following options in the `apm-server.ssl` section of the +{beatname_lc}.yml+ config file.
They apply to SSL/TLS communication between the APM Server and APM Agents.

[float]
==== `enabled`

The `enabled` setting can be used to enable the ssl configuration by setting
it to `true`. The default value is `false`.

[float]
==== `certificate`

The path to the file containing the certificate for Server authentication.
Required if `apm-server.ssl.enabled` is `true`.

[float]
==== `key`

The path to the file containing the Server certificate key.
Required if `apm-server.ssl.enabled` is `true`.

[float]
==== `certificate_authorities`

The list of root certificates for verifying client certificates.
If `certificate_authorities` is empty or not set, the trusted certificate authorities of the host system are used.

[float]
==== `key_passphrase`

The passphrase used to decrypt an encrypted key stored in the configured `key` file.
We recommend saving the `key_passphrase` in the APM Server <<keystore>>.

[float]
==== `supported_protocols`

This setting is a list of allowed protocol versions:
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1.0`, `TLSv1.1` and `TLSv1.2`. We do not recommend using `SSLv3` or `TLSv1.0`.
The default value is `[TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]`.

[float]
==== `cipher_suites`

The list of cipher suites to use. The first entry has the highest priority.
If this option is omitted, the Go crypto library's default
suites are used (recommended).

[float]
==== `curve_types`

The list of curve types for ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange).

[float]
==== `client_authentication`

This configures what types of client authentication are supported. The valid options
are `none`, `optional`, and `required`. The default is `optional`.
If `certificate_authorities` has been specified, this setting will automatically change to `required`.

* `none` - Disables client authentication.
* `optional` - When a client certificate is given, the server will verify it.
* `required` - Requires clients to provide a valid certificate.

[float]
==== `verification_mode`

This option controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host
names. Valid values are `none` and `full`. If `none` is used,
SSL-based connections are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this
option for testing only.

The default is `full`.
