=== Breaking Changes
APM Server is built on top of {beats-ref}/index.html[libbeat].
As such, any breaking change in libbeat is also considered to be a breaking change in APM Server.

==== 7.7
* There are no breaking changes in APM Server.
However, a previously hardcoded feature is now configurable.
Failing to follow these <<upgrading-to-77,upgrade steps>> will result in increased span metadata ingestion when upgrading to version 7.7.

[float]
==== 7.6
* There are no breaking changes in APM Server.

[float]
==== 7.5
* Introduced dedicated `apm-server.ilm.setup.*` flags.
This means you can now customize ILM behavior from within the APM Server configuration.
As a side effect, `setup.template.*` settings will be ignored for ILM related templates per event type.
See {apm-server-ref}/ilm.html#ilm-setup[set up ILM] for more information.

* By default, ILM policies will not longer be versioned.
All event types will switch to the new default policy: rollover after 30 days or when reaching a size 50gb.
See {apm-server-ref}/ilm.html[default policy] for more information.

* To make use of all the new features introduced in 7.5,
you must ensure you are using version 7.5+ of APM Server and version 7.5+ of Kibana.
