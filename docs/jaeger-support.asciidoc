==== Get started

Connect your preexisting Jaeger setup to Elastic APM in three steps:

* <<jaeger-configure-agent-client>>
* <<jaeger-configure-sampling>>
* <<jaeger-configure-start>>

IMPORTANT: There are <<jaeger-caveats,caveats>> to this integration.

==== Configure Jaeger agents

APM Server serves Jaeger gRPC over the same <<host,host and port>> as the Elastic APM agent protocol.

[[jaeger-configure-sampling]]
==== Configure Sampling

APM Server supports probabilistic sampling, which can be used to reduce the amount of data that your agents collect and send.
Probabilistic sampling makes a random sampling decision based on the configured sampling value.
For example, a value of `.2` means that 20% of traces will be sampled.

There are two different ways to configure the sampling rate of your Jaeger agents:

* <<jaeger-configure-sampling-central,APM Agent central configuration (default)>>
* <<jaeger-configure-sampling-local,Local sampling in each Jaeger client>>

[float]
[[jaeger-configure-sampling-central]]
===== APM Agent central configuration (default)

Central sampling, with APM Agent central configuration,
allows Jaeger clients to poll APM Server for the sampling rate.
This means sample rates can be configured on the fly, on a per-service and per-environment basis.

[float]
[[jaeger-configure-sampling-local]]
===== Local sampling in each Jaeger client

If you don't have access to the APM app,
you'll need to change the Jaeger client's `sampler.type` and `sampler.param`.
This enables you to set the sampling configuration locally in each Jaeger client.
See the official https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.22/sampling/[Jaeger sampling documentation]
for more information.

[[jaeger-configure-start]]
==== Start sending span data

That's it! Data sent from Jaeger clients to the APM Server can now be viewed in the APM app.
