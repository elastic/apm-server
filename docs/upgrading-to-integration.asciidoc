=== Why upgrade?

The new APM ecosystem offers a number of benefits:

**{fleet}**:

* A single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, traces, and other types of data to each host -- install one thing instead of multiple
* Central, unified configuration management -- no need to edit multiple configuration files

**Data streams**:

* Reduced number of fields per index, better space efficiency, and faster queries
* More granular data control
* Errors and metrics data streams are shared with other data sources -- which means better long-term integration with the logs and metrics apps
* Removes template inheritance for ILM policies and makes use of new {es} index and component templates
* Fixes <<server-resource-exists-not-alias>>

**APM Integration**:

* Easier to install APM on edge machines
* Improved source map handling and APM agent configuration management
* Less configuration
* Easier and less error-prone upgrade path
* Zero-downtime configuration changes

=== APM integration architecture

The Elastic APM integration consists of four components: *APM agents*, the *Elastic APM integration*, *Elasticsearch*, and *Kibana*.
Generally, there are two ways that these four components can work together:

APM agents on edge machines send data to a centrally hosted APM integration:

image::./images/apm-architecture.png[Architecture of Elastic APM]

Or, APM agents and the APM integration live on edge machines and enroll via a centrally hosted {agent}:

NOTE: In order to collect data from RUM and mobile agents, which run in browser and mobile applications,
you must run {agent} centrally. For other applications, such as backend services,
{agent} may be co-located on the edge machine.

[[apm-integration-upgrade-limitations]]
=== Limitations

There are some limitations to be aware of:

* This change cannot be reverted
* Currently, only the {es} output is supported
* APM runs under {agent} which, depending on the installation method, might be require root privileges
* An {agent} with the APM integration enabled must be managed by {fleet}.

=== Upgrade a self-managed cluster

. <<apm-integration-upgrade-4>>
. <<apm-integration-upgrade-5>>

==== Upgrade the Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack ({es} and {kib}) must be upgraded to version 7.14 or higher.
See the {stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Elastic Stack Installation and Upgrade Guide] for guidance.

Review the APM <<release-notes,release notes>>, <<apm-breaking,breaking changes>>,
and Observability {observability-guide}/whats-new.html[What's new] content for important changes between
your current APM version and this one.

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-2]]
==== Add a {fleet} Server

{fleet} Server is a component of the {stack} used to centrally manage {agent}s.
The APM integration requires a {fleet} Server to be running and accessible to your hosts.
Add a {fleet} Server by following {fleet-guide}/add-a-fleet-server.html[this guide].

TIP: If you're upgrading a self-managed deployment of the {stack}, you'll need to enable
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[{es} security] and the
{ref}/security-settings.html[API key service].

After adding your {fleet} Server host and generating a service token, the in-product help in {kib}
will provide a command to run to start an {agent} as a {fleet} Server.
Commands may require administrator privileges.

Verify {fleet} Server is running by navigating to **Fleet** > **Agents** in {kib}.

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-3]]
==== Install a {fleet}-managed {agent}

NOTE: It's possible to install the Elastic APM integration on the same {agent} that is running the {fleet} Server integration. For this use case, skip this step.

The {fleet}-managed {agent} will run the Elastic APM integration on your edge nodes, next to your applications.
To install a {fleet}-managed {agent}, follow {fleet-guide}/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html[this guide].

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-4]]
==== Add the APM integration

The APM integration receives performance data from your APM agents,
validates and processes it, and then transforms the data into {es} documents.

To add the APM integration, see <<add-apm-integration>>.
Only complete the linked step (not the entire quick start guide).
If you're adding the APM integration to a {fleet}-managed {agent}, you can use the default policy.
If you're adding the APM integration to the {fleet} Server, use the policy that the {fleet} Server is running on.

TIP: You'll configure the APM integration in this step.
See <<input-apm>> for a reference of all available settings.
As long as the APM integration is configured with the same secret token or you have API keys enabled on the same host,
no reconfiguration is required in your APM agents.

[[apm-integration-upgrade-5]]
==== Stop the legacy APM Server

Once data from upgraded APM agents is visible in the APM app,
it's safe to stop the legacy APM Server process.

Congratulations -- you've now upgraded to the latest and greatest in Elastic APM!

=== Upgrade an {ecloud} cluster

==== Upgrade the Elastic Stack

Use the {ecloud} console to upgrade the {stack} to version {version}.
See the {cloud}/ec-upgrade-deployment.html[{ess} upgrade guide] for details.

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-ess-2]]
==== Switch to Elastic Agent

APM data collection will be interrupted while the migration is in progress.
The process of migrating should only take a few minutes.

With a Superuser account, complete the following steps:

. In {kib}, navigate to **Observability** > **APM** > **Settings** > **Schema**.
+
image::./images/schema-agent.png[switch to {agent}]

. Click **Switch to {agent}**.
Make a note of the `apm-server.yml` user settings that are incompatible with {agent}.
Check the confirmation box and click **Switch to {agent}**.
+
image::./images/agent-settings-migration.png[{agent} settings migration]

{ecloud} will now create a Fleet Server instance to contain the new APM integration,
and then will shut down the old APM server instance.
Within minutes your data should begin appearing in the APM app again.

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-ess-3]]
==== Configure the APM integration

You can now update settings that were removed during the upgrade.
See <<input-apm>> for a reference of all available settings.

In {kib}, navigate to **Mangement** > **Fleet**.
Select the **Elastic Cloud Agent Policy**.
Next to the **Elastic APM** integration, select **Actions** > **Edit integration**.

[discrete]
[[apm-integration-upgrade-ess-4]]
==== Scale APM and Fleet

Certain {es} output configuration options are not available with the APM integration.
To ensure data is not lost, you can scale APM and Fleet up and out.
APM's capacity to process events increases with the instance memory size.

Go to the {ess-console}[{ecloud} console], select your deployment and click **Edit**.
Here you can edit the number and size of each availability zone.

Congratulations -- you’ve now upgraded to the latest and greatest in Elastic APM!
