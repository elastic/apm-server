Welcome to APM Server Docs.

NOTE: The documentation pages are still work in progress.
For more details also check APM Server https://github.com/elastic/apm-server[Github repository].

APM Server is a central component in the Elastic APM system.
It receives data from APM agents and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents.

To get an overview about the whole Elastic APM system,
please also have a look at the documentation for

* {apm-node-ref}/index.html[APM Node.js Agent]
* {apm-py-ref}/index.html[APM Python Agent]
* {ref}/index.html[Elasticsearch]

See how to {apm-get-started}/index.html[Get Started] with the Elastic APM system.

A single APM server can handle data from multiple apps.
APM Server works by exposing an HTTP server to which agents post the APM data they collect.
This includes performance information about the applications,
as well as errors that occur in applications.

APM Server is an application built in Go using the beats framework 
and as such it shares many of the same configuration options as beats.
