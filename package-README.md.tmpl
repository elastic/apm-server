## Getting Started

To get started with APM Server, you need to set up Elasticsearch on your
localhost first. After that, start APM Server with:

     ./{{.BeatName}} -c {{.BeatName}}.yml -e

This will start APM Server and send the data to your Elasticsearch instance. To
load the dashboards for APM Server into Kibana, run:

    ./{{.BeatName}} setup -e
