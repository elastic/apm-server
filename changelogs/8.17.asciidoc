- The default data lifecycle management mechanism is getting reverted from Data Stream Lifecycle (DSL) to Index Lifecycle Management (ILM), as originally used prior to the introduction of the APM data plugin in release 8.15.0.
  No action is required from users for this change.
  However, any custom DSL settings will not be preserved during the migration.
