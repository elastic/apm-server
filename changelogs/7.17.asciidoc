==== Breaking changes

This APM release updates Go to version 1.18.5.
The https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#sha1[Go release notes] for this version note the following change to TLS:

****
**Rejecting SHA-1 certificates**

`crypto/x509`` will now reject certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash function. This doesn't apply to self-signed root certificates. Practical attacks against SHA-1 https://shattered.io/[have been demonstrated since 2017] and publicly trusted Certificate Authorities have not issued SHA-1 certificates since 2015.

This can be temporarily reverted by setting the `GODEBUG=x509sha1=1` environment variable. This option will be removed in a future release.
