=== 8.0

// tag::80-bc[]
The following breaking changes are introduced in APM version 8.0.

[float]
==== Indices are now manged by {fleet}

All index management has been removed from APM Server;
{fleet} is now entirely responsible for setting up index templates, index lifecycle polices,
and index pipelines.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.ilm.*`
* `apm-server.register.ingest.pipeline.*`
* `setup.*`

[float]
==== Data streams by default

APM Server now only writes to well-defined data streams;
writing to classic indices is no longer supported.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.data_streams.enabled`
* `output.elasticsearch.index`
* `output.elasticsearch.indices`
* `output.elasticsearch.pipeline`
* `output.elasticsearch.pipelines`

[float]
==== New {es} output

APM Server has a new {es} output implementation; it is no longer necessary to manually
tune the output of APM Server.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `output.elasticsearch.bulk_max_size`
* `output.elasticsearch.worker`
* `queue.*`

[float]
==== New source map upload endpoint

The source map upload endpoint has been removed from APM Server.
Source maps should now be uploaded directly to {kib} instead.

[float]
==== Legacy Jaeger endpoints have been removed

The legacy Jaeger gRPC and HTTP endpoints have been removed from APM Server.

As a part of this change, the following settings have been removed:

* `apm-server.jaeger`

[float]
==== Homebrew no longer supported

APM Server no longer supports installation via Homebrew.
