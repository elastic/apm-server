****
The APM integration for {agent} is now generally available!
This new APM ecosystem brings a number of new benefits to Elastic APM.
Learn more about this change in the {apm-guide-ref}/upgrade-to-apm-integration.html[Upgrade guide].
Documentation for standalone APM Server has moved to the {apm-guide-ref}/legacy-apm-overview.html[Legacy APM Overview] and {apm-guide-ref}/overview.html[Legacy APM Server Reference].
