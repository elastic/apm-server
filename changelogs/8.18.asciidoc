==== Bug fixes
- Fix overflow in validation of `apm-server.agent.config.cache.expiration` on 32-bit architectures {pull}15216[15216]
- Change permissions of `apm-server.yml` in `tar.gz` artifacts to `0600` {pull}15627[15627]
- Tail-based sampling: Fix an issue with the "drop and recreate Badger DB on storage limit exceeded" mitigation introduced in 8.17.1 and 8.16.3. Previously, a bug in this mitigation caused the tail sampling storage size to remain between 90% and 100% of the configured limit without triggering the intended mitigation. {pull}16385[16385]
