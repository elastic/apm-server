[[release-notes-7.9]]
== APM Server version 7.9

https://github.com/elastic/apm-server/compare/7.8\...7.9[View commits]

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Known Issue:* APM Server introduced support for cloud metadata in v7.9 ({pull}3729[3729]).
Unfortunately, the JSON Schema was too strict, and does not account for `null` values.
As a result, sending `null` values for cloud metadata causes the payload to be rejected.
This issue was resolved in v7.10.0 ({pull}4142[4142]).
To avoid problems, we recommend updating to version â‰¥7.10.0.
