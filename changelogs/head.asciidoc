==== Added
- The `error.log.message` or `error.exception.message` field of errors will be copied to the ECS field `message` {pull}5974[5974]
- Define index sorting for internal metrics data stream {pull}6116[6116]

- We now collect span destination metrics for transactions with too many spans (for example due to transaction_max_spans or exit_span_min_duration) when collected and sent by APM agents {pull}6200[6200]
- Add an experimental endpoint for AWS Kinesis Data Firehose {pull}6299[6299]
- `output.elasticsearch.experimental` can be used to enable a new, experimental Elasticsearch output using the go-elasticsearch client {pull}5970[5970]

- Introduced a delete phase for all data streams. Traces, errors and logs are kept for 10 days, metrics are kept for 90 days {pull}6480[6480]
- Changed RUM traces to use a dedicated data stream (`traces-apm.rum`). RUM traces are kept for 90 days {pull}6480[6480]

[float]
==== Deprecated
- Setting `service.version` as a span tag (Jaeger) or attribute (OTel) is deprecated; use tracer tags (Jaeger) and resource attributes (OTel) {pull}6131[6131]
