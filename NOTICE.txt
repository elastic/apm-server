    ELASTIC LICENSE AGREEMENT

    PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THIS ELASTIC LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS "AGREEMENT"), WHICH
    CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS ALL OF YOUR USE OF ALL OF
    THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THIS AGREEMENT IS INCLUDED ("ELASTIC SOFTWARE")
    THAT IS PROVIDED IN OBJECT CODE FORMAT, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 2 BELOW,
    CERTAIN OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED IN SOURCE CODE FORMAT. BY
    INSTALLING OR USING ANY OF THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU
    ARE ASSENTING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
    WITH SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE
    GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE ON
    BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL
    AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF
    SUCH ENTITY.

    Posted Date: April 20, 2018

    This Agreement is entered into by and between Elasticsearch BV ("Elastic") and
    You, or the legal entity on behalf of whom You are acting (as applicable,
    "You").

    1. OBJECT CODE END USER LICENSES, RESTRICTIONS AND THIRD PARTY OPEN SOURCE
    SOFTWARE

      1.1 Object Code End User License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      Section 1.2 of this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and
      for so long as you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a
      License to the Basic Features and Functions of the Elastic Software.

      1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Elastic and You, Elastic
      and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Elastic
      Software, and except as expressly set forth in Sections 1.1, and 2.1 of this
      Agreement, no other license to the Elastic Software is granted to You under
      this Agreement, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. You agree not to: (i)
      reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any
      Elastic Software provided to You in Object Code, or any portion thereof, to
      Source Code, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited
      by applicable law, (ii) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement,
      prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Elastic Software Object
      Code or the Commercial Software Source Code in any manner; (iii) except as
      expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease,
      distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer, Elastic Software Object
      Code, in whole or in part, to any third party; (iv) use Elastic Software
      Object Code for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service,
      service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or
      other service offering (collectively, "SaaS Offering") where obtaining access
      to the Elastic Software or the features and functions of the Elastic Software
      is a primary reason or substantial motivation for users of the SaaS Offering
      to access and/or use the SaaS Offering ("Prohibited SaaS Offering"); (v)
      circumvent the limitations on use of Elastic Software provided to You in
      Object Code format that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, or (vi)
      alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Elastic Software. If You have any
      question as to whether a specific SaaS Offering constitutes a Prohibited SaaS
      Offering, or are interested in obtaining Elastic's permission to engage in
      commercial or non-commercial distribution of the Elastic Software, please
      contact elastic_license@elastic.co.

      1.3 Third Party Open Source Software. The Commercial Software may contain or
      be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and
      other open source software (collectively, "Open Source Software"), which Open
      Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website
      designated by Elastic. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of
      the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions
      applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the
      applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted
      to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). To the extent any
      condition of this Agreement conflicts with any license to the Open Source
      Software, the Open Source Software license will govern with respect to such
      Open Source Software only. Elastic may also separately provide you with
      certain open source software that is licensed by Elastic. Your use of such
      Elastic open source software will not be governed by this Agreement, but by
      the applicable open source license terms.

    2. COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SOURCE CODE

      2.1 Limited License. Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2 of
      this Agreement, Elastic hereby grants to You, AT NO CHARGE and for so long as
      you are not in breach of any provision of this Agreement, a limited,
      non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully paid up royalty free right and license
      to the Commercial Software in Source Code format, without the right to grant
      or authorize sublicenses, to prepare Derivative Works of the Commercial
      Software, provided You (i) do not hack the licensing mechanism, or otherwise
      circumvent the intended limitations on the use of Elastic Software to enable
      features other than Basic Features and Functions or those features You are
      entitled to as part of a Subscription, and (ii) use the resulting object code
      only for reasonable testing purposes.

      2.2 Restrictions. Nothing in Section 2.1 grants You the right to (i) use the
      Commercial Software Source Code other than in accordance with Section 2.1
      above, (ii) use a Derivative Work of the Commercial Software outside of a
      Non-production Environment, in any production capacity, on a temporary or
      permanent basis, or (iii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense,
      loan or otherwise make available the Commercial Software Source Code, in whole
      or in part, to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may
      maintain a copy of the repository in which the Source Code of the Commercial
      Software resides and that copy may be publicly accessible, provided that you
      include this Agreement with Your copy of the repository.

    3. TERMINATION

      3.1 Termination. This Agreement will automatically terminate, whether or not
      You receive notice of such Termination from Elastic, if You breach any of its
      provisions.

      3.2 Post Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, for any reason,
      You shall promptly cease the use of the Elastic Software in Object Code format
      and cease use of the Commercial Software in Source Code format. For the
      avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement will not affect Your right
      to use Elastic Software, in either Object Code or Source Code formats, made
      available under the Apache License Version 2.0.

      3.3 Survival. Sections 1.2, 2.2. 3.3, 4 and 5 shall survive any termination or
      expiration of this Agreement.

    4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

      4.1 Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE
      LAW, THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
      AND ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR
      STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
      PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY
      DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, AND WITH
      RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING. FURTHER, ELASTIC DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS
      OF USE OR THAT THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT THE USE OF THE
      ELASTIC SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

      4.2 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL ELASTIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE
      LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
      INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN CONNECTION WITH
      OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ELASTIC SOFTWARE, OR THE
      PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A
      BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF ELASTIC
      HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    5. MISCELLANEOUS

      This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the
      parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms
      govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the
      parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be
      modified by Elastic from time to time, and any such modifications will be
      effective upon the "Posted Date" set forth at the top of the modified
      Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will
      continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original
      intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation
      arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by Dutch law.
      This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts
      for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in
      connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be
      resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, except
      where mandatory law provides for the courts at another location in The
      Netherlands to have jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and
      all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or
      proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal
      jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or
      defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 2 may cause
      irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and
      therefore Elastic shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being
      required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by
      operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in
      part to any third party without the prior written consent of Elastic, which
      may be withheld or granted by Elastic in its sole and absolute discretion.
      Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to
      Elastic may also be sent to legal@elastic.co.

         non-exclusive license:

         a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

    2.2. Effective Date

         The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
         effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
         such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
         License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
         or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
         2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

         a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

         c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
            Contributions.

         This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
         logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
         notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
         distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
         (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
         under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

         Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
         are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
         rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

         This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
         copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

         Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
         Section 2.1.


    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
         terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
         of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
         they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
         restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
            or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
            the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
            rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
         Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
         with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
         Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
         You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
         such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
         their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
         either this License or such Secondary License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
         copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
         of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
         Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
         required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
         of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
         warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
         alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
       order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
       to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
       they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
       distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
       extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
       sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
       understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
         if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
         reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
         Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
         ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
         non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
         compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
         and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
         all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
         shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
       warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
       without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
       merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
       risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
       Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
       Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
       correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
       License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
       except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
       party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
       Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
       consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
       a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
       and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
       reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
       prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
       hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
       provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
       enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
       contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
       this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
          the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
          under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
          version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
          references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
          modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
          If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
          Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
          notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

          obtain one at
          http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
    You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
    directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

         terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
         of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
         they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
         restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
            or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
            the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
            rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
         Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
         with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
         Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
         You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
         such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
         their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
         either this License or such Secondary License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
         copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
         of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
         Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
         required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
         of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
         warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
         alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
       order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
       to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
       they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
       distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
       extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
       sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
       understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
         if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
         reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
         Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
         ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
         non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
         compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
         and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
         all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
         shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
       warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
       without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
       merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
       risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
       Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
       Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
       correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
       License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
       except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
       party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
       Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
       consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
       a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
       and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
       reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
       prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
       hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
       provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
       enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
       contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
       this License against a Contributor.

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of

          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
          version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
          references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
          modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
          If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
          Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

         distributes such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
         this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the

         the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
         the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
         Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
         License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
         attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
         Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
         the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
         Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
         Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
         License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
         under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
         the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
         Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
         License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
         (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
         limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
         Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
         extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
         You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
       judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
       this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
       limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
       text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
       this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
       such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
       skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
         basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
         compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
         reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
         non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
         received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
         Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
         of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
         counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
         You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
         2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
       without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
       including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
       of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
       The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
       is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
       You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
       repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
       this License except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
       such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
       limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
       incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
       not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
       of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
       business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
       jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
       in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
       counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
       matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
       the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
       be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
          or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
          modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
          any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
          such modified license differs from this License).

          Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
          Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of

    2. License Grants and Conditions

    2.1. Grants

         Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license:

         a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and

            sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.

    2.2. Effective Date

         The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
         become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
         distributes such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
         this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
         distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
         Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
         Contributor:

         a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

         c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.

         This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
         or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
         the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
         distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
         License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
         permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

         Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
         Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
         grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

         This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
         applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
         equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

         Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
         Section 2.1.


    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
         the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
         Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
         License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
         attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
         Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
         the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
         Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
         Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
         License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
         under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
         the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
         Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
         License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
         (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
         limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
         Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
         extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
         You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
       judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
       this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
       limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
       text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
       this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
       such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
       skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
         basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
         compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
         reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
         non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
         received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
         Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
         of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
         counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
         You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
         2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
       without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
       including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
       of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
       The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
       is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
       You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
       repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
       this License except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
       such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
       limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
       incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
       not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
       of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
       business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
       jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
       in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
       counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
       matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
       the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
       be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
          or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
          modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
          any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
          such modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
          Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
          Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
          the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
          attached.

    Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

          This Source Code Form is subject to the
          terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
          2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
          distributed with this file, You can
          obtain one at
          http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
    then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
    relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
    notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

          With Secondary Licenses", as defined by
