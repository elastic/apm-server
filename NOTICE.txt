            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    2.2. Effective Date

         The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
         become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
         distributes such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
         this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
         distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
         Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
         Contributor:

         a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

         c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.

         This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
         or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
         the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
         distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
         License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
         permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

         Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
         Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
         grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

         This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
         applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
         equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

         Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
         Section 2.1.


    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
         the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
         Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
         License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
         attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
         Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
         the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
         Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
         Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
         License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
         under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
         the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
         Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
         License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
         (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
         limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
         Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
         extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
         You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
       judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
       this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
       limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
       text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
       this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
       such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
       skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
         basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
         compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
         reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
         non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
         received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
         Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
         of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
         counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
         You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
         2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
       without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
       including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
       of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
       The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
       is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
       You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
       repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
       this License except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
       such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
       limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
       incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
       not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
       of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
       business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
       jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
       in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
       counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
       matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
       the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
       be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
          or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
          modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
          any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
          such modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
          Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
          Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
          the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
          attached.

          obtain one at
          http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
    then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
    relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
    notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

          This Source Code Form is "Incompatible
          With Secondary Licenses", as defined by

          License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is
          controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this
          definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause
          the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
          outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.


    2. License Grants and Conditions

    2.1. Grants

         Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license:

         a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and

         b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
            sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.

    2.2. Effective Date

         The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
         become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
         distributes such Contribution.

    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
         this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
         distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
         Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
         Contributor:

         a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or

         c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.

         This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
         or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
         the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
         distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
         License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
         permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

         Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
         Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
         grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

         This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
         applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
         equivalents.

    2.7. Conditions

         Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
         Section 2.1.


    3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
         the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
         Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
         License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
         attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
         Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
            as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
            Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
            reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
            of distribution to the recipient; and

         b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
            recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
         the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
         Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
         Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
         License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
         under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
         the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
         Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
         License(s).

    3.4. Notices

         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
         (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
         limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
         Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
         extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
         You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

       If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
       with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
       judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
       this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
       limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
       text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
       this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
       such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
       skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
         fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
         then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
         are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
         explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
         basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
         some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
         compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
         reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
         non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
         received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
         Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
         of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
         counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
         You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
         2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
         license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
         validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

       Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
       without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
       including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
       of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
       The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
       is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
       You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
       repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
       part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
       this License except under this disclaimer.

    7. Limitation of Liability

       Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
       negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
       distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
       direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
       character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
       goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
       informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
       shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
       such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
       limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
       incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
       not apply to You.

    8. Litigation

       Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
       of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
       business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
       jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
       in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
       counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous

       This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
       matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
       unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
       necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
       the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
       be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
          or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
          modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
          any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
          such modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
          Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
          Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
          the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
          attached.

    Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

          This Source Code Form is subject to the
          terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
          2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
          distributed with this file, You can
          obtain one at
          http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
    then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
    relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
    notice.

    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

          This Source Code Form is "Incompatible
          With Secondary Licenses", as defined by
          the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
