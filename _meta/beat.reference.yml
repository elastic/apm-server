    # Comma separated list of permitted origins for frontend. User-agents will send
    # a origin header that will be validated against this list.
    # An origin is made of a protocol scheme, host and port, without the url path.
    # Allowed origins in this setting can have * to match anything (eg.: http://*.example.com)
    # If an item in the list is a single *, everything will be allowed
    #allow_origins : *

    # Regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame's `file_name` and `abs_path` attributes,
    # If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is considered to be a library frame.

    #sourcemapping:

      # Source Maps are are fetched from Elasticsearch and then kept in an in-memory cache for a certain time.
      # The `cache.expiration` determines how long a Source Map should be cached before fetching it again from Elasticsearch.
      # Note that values configured without a time unit will be interpreted as seconds.
      #cache:
        #expiration: 5m

      # Sourcemaps are stored in the same index as transaction and error documents.
      # If the default index pattern at 'outputs.elasticsearch.index' is changed,
      # a matching index pattern needs to be specified here.
      # Note that an '*' is added automatically to this index pattern when querying for sourcemaps.
