############################# APM Server ######################################

apm-server:
  # Defines the host and port the server is listening on
  #host: "localhost:8200"

  # Maximum permitted size in bytes of an unzipped request accepted by the server to be processed.
  #max_unzipped_size: 52428800
  # Maximum permitted size in bytes of a request's header accepted by the server to be processed.
  #max_header_size: 1048576

  # Maximum permitted duration in seconds for reading an entire request.
  #read_timeout: 2s
  # Maximum permitted duration in seconds for writing a response.
  #write_timeout: 2s

  # Maximum duration in seconds before releasing resources when shutting down the server.
  #shutdown_timeout: 5s

  # Maximum number of requests permitted to be sent to the server concurrently.
  #concurrent_requests: 40

  # Authorization token to be checked. If a token is set here the agents must
  # send their token in the following format: Authorization: Bearer <secret-token>.
  # It is recommended to use an authorization token in combination with SSL enabled.
  #secret_token:
  #ssl.enabled: false
  #ssl.certificate : "path/to/cert"
  #ssl.key : "path/to/private_key"

  # Please be aware that frontend support is an experimental feature at the moment!
  #frontend:
    # To enable experimental frontend support set this to true.
    #enabled: false

    # Rate limit per second and IP address for requests sent to the frontend endpoint.
    #rate_limit: 10

    # Comma separated list of permitted origins for frontend. User-agents will send
    # a origin header that will be validated against this list.
    # An origin is made of a protocol scheme, host and port, without the url path.
    # Allowed origins in this setting can have * to match anything (eg.: http://*.example.com)
    # If an item in the list is a single '*', everything will be allowed
    #allow_origins : ['*']

    # Regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame's `file_name` and `abs_path` attributes.
    # If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is considered to be a library frame.
    #library_pattern: "node_modules|bower_components|~"

    # If a source map has previously been uploaded, source mapping is automatically applied
    # to all error and transaction documents sent to the frontend endpoint.
    #source_mapping:

      # Source maps are are fetched from Elasticsearch and then kept in an in-memory cache for a certain time.
      # The `cache.expiration` determines how long a source map should be cached before fetching it again from Elasticsearch.
      # Note that values configured without a time unit will be interpreted as seconds.
      #cache:
        #expiration: 5m

      # Source maps are stored in the same index as transaction and error documents.
      # If the default index pattern at 'outputs.elasticsearch.index' is changed,
      # a matching index pattern needs to be specified here.
      #index_pattern: "apm*"
