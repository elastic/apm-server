# Define versions exceptions to lazy rollovers.
#
# All versions listed are expected to have a lazy rollover. An exception may be
# needed, to specify that upgrading from a previous version does not trigger
# a lazy rollover. In this case that version must be specified as a entry in the 
# minor or patch release key.
# Keys can be in the form of major.minor or major.minor.patch.
# Values can be in the form of major.minor or major.minor.patch.
#
# Example: upgrading to 8.18 will trigger a lazy rollover from any previous
#          version.
# ```
# 8.18:
# ```
#
# Example: upgrading to 8.18 will trigger a lazy rollover from all previous
#          versions except any 8.17 ones (all patches included).:
# ```
# 8.18:
#   - 8.17
# ```
#
# Example: upgrading to 8.18.1 will trigger a lazy rollover from any previous
#              version.
# ```
# 8.18.1:
# ```
# 
# Example: upgrading to 8.18 will trigger a lazy rollover from all previous
#          versions except 8.17.8.
# ```
# 8.18:
#   - 8.17.8
# ```
#
# NOTE: If a version is not in this list it is **not** expected to rollover.
# NOTE: quote major.minor when used as values or they'll be floats
