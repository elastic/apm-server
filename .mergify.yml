          branches, such as:
          * `backport-7.x` is the label to automatically backport to the `7.x` branch.
          * `backport-7./d` is the label to automatically backport to the `7./d` branch. `/d` is the digit

          **NOTE**: `backport-skip` has been added to this pull request.
      label:
        add:
          - backport-skip
  - name: remove backport-skip label
    conditions:
      - label~=^backport-\d
    actions:
      label:
        remove:
          - backport-skip
