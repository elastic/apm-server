          * `backport-7.17` is the label to automatically backport to the 7.17 branch.
          * `backport-8./d` is the label to automatically backport to the `8./d` branch. `/d` is the digit.
          * `backport-9./d` is the label to automatically backport to the `9./d` branch. `/d` is the digit.
          * `backport-active-all` is the label that automatically backports to all active branches.
          * `backport-active-8` is the label that automatically backports to all active minor branches for the 8 major.
          * `backport-active-9` is the label that automatically backports to all active minor branches for the 9 major.
