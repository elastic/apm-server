# APM Server (Experimental)

The APM Server receives data from the Elastic APM agents and stores the data into Elasticsearch. The APM Server and the
APM agents are currently experimental and under heavy development which can also includes breaking changes. If you are
trying out APM and have feedback or problems, please post them on the [Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm).

## APM Getting Started

To run Elastic APM for your own applications you need the following setup:

* Install & Run [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/_installation.html) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.0/install.html)
* Build and run the APM Server
* Install the [Node.js](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-nodejs) or [Python](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-python) APM Agent in your app

By default the agents send data to localhost, the APM Server listens on localhost and sends data to Elasticsearch on localhost.
If your setups involves multiple hosts, you need to adjust the configuration options accordingly.

## Load Dashboards

To get started with APM we provide some example dashboards. Currently the dashboards have to be loaded manually with the following command:

```
curl --user elastic:changeme -XPOST http://localhost:5601/api/kibana/dashboards/import -H 'Content-type:application/json' -H 'kbn-xsrf:true' -d @./_meta/kibana/default/dashboard/apm-dashboards.json
```

## APM Server Development

### Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.8.3

### Install

+ Fork the repo with the Github interface and clone it:

```
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/elastic/
git clone git@github.com:[USER]/apm-server.git
```
Note that it should be cloned from the fork (replace [USER] with your Github user), not from origin.

+ Add the upstream remote:
```git remote add elastic git@github.com:elastic/apm-server.git```

### Build

To build the binary for Apm-Server run the command below. This will generate a binary
in the same directory with the name apm-server.

```
make
```

### Run

To run Apm-Server with debugging output enabled, run:

```
./apm-server -c apm-server.yml -e -d "*"
```

### Testing
For Testing check out the [testing guide](TESTING.md)

### Update

Each beat has a template for the mapping in elasticsearch and a documentation for the fields
which is automatically generated based on `etc/fields.yml`.
To generate etc/apm-server.template.json and etc/apm-server.asciidoc

```
make update
```

### Cleanup

To clean Apm-Server source code, run the following commands:

```
make fmt
```

To clean up the build directory and generated artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```

For further development, check out the [beat developer guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/new-beat.html).

## Packaging

The beat frameworks provides tools to crosscompile and package your beat for different platforms. This requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and vendoring as described above. To build packages of your beat, run the following command:

```
make package
```

This will fetch and create all images required for the build process. The hole process to finish can take several minutes.

## Update Dependencies

The `apm-server` has two types of dependencies:

* Golang packages managed with `govendor`
* Beats framework managed with `cd _beats && sh update.sh`

It is recommended to keep the version of the beats framework and libbeat in sync. To make an update of both, run `make update-beats`.

### Govendor

For details on [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) check the docs [here](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).

To update beats to the most recent version from your go path for example use: `govendor fetch github.com/elastic/beats/...`.
Govendor will automatically pick the files needed.

### Framework Update

To update the beats framework run `make update-beats`. This will fetch the most recent version of beats from master and copy
the files which are needed for the framework part to the `_beats` directory. These are files like libbeat config files and
scripts which are used for testing or packaging.

To update the dependency to a specific commit or branch run command as following:

```
BEATS_VERSION=f240148065af94d55c5149e444482b9635801f27 make update-beats
```

## Test environment

For manual testing with the elastic stack and the agents there is a test environment based on docker. To
get this running execute the following commands.

* Run `make start-env`
* Run 3 times around your table, it takes ES quite a bit to startup completely with X-Pack
* Go to `localhost:5000` or `localhost:5000/error` and press refresh a few times
* Open `localhost:5601` in your browser and log into Kibana with `elastic` and `changeme`
* Create the `apm-server-*` index pattern
* In Kibana go to the Discovery tab and you should see data

For manual testing with specific agents, check instructions at `tests/agent/[LANG]/README.md`

## Documentation

A JSON-Schema spec for the API lives in `docs/spec`. 
ElasticSearch fields are defined in `_meta/fields.generated.yml`.
Examples of input and output documents can be found at `docs/data/intake-api` and `docs/data/elasticsearch` respectively.
