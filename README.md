# APM Server

The APM Server receives data from Elastic APM agents and transforms it into Elasticsearch documents.
Read more about Elastic APM at [elastic.co/apm](https://www.elastic.co/apm).

For questions and feature requests, visit the [discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm).

## Getting Started

To get started with APM, see our [Quick start guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/install-and-run.html).

## APM Server Development

### Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.15.12

### Install

* Fork the repo with the GitHub interface and clone it:

```
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/elastic/
git clone git@github.com:[USER]/apm-server.git
```

Note that it should be cloned from the fork (replace [USER] with your GitHub user), not from origin.

* Add the upstream remote:

```
git remote add elastic git@github.com:elastic/apm-server.git
```

### Build

To build the binary for APM Server run the command below. This will generate a binary
in the same directory with the name apm-server.

```
make
```

You also need to create all files needed by the APM Server by running the additional command below.

```
make update
```

Note that this requires to have `python >= 3.7` and `venv` installed.

### Run

To run APM Server with debugging output enabled, run:

```
./apm-server -c apm-server.yml -e -d "*"
```

### Testing

For Testing check out the [testing guide](TESTING.md)

### Update

Each beat has a template for the mapping in elasticsearch and a documentation for the fields
which is automatically generated based on `fields.yml`.
To generate required configuration files and templates run:

```
make update
```

### Generate package

APM-Server includes a script to generate an integration package to run with Fleet.
To Generate a package run:

```
make fields gen-package
```

That command takes the existing `fields.yml` files and split them into `ecs.yml` and `fields.yml` files for each data stream type.
It also generates a `README.md` with a field reference that will be shown in the integration package.

After generating a package, `apmpackage/apm` should be manually copied to `elastic/integrations`.
Then follow instructions in https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Cleanup

To clean APM Server source code, run the following commands:

```
make fmt
```

To clean up the build directory and generated artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```

For further development, check out the [beat developer guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/new-beat.html).

### Contributing

See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details about reporting bugs, requesting features,
or contributing to APM Server.

### Releases

See [releases](RELEASES.md) for an APM Server release checklist.

## Updating dependencies

APM Server uses Go Modules for dependency management, without any vendoring.

In general, you should use standard `go get` commands to add and update modules. The one exception to this
is the dependency on `libbeat`, for which there exists a special Make target: `make update-beats`, described
below.

### Updating libbeat

By running `make update-beats` the `github.com/elastic/beats/vN` module will be updated to the most recent
commit from the master branch, and a minimal set of files will be copied into the apm-server tree.

You can specify an alternative branch or commit by specifying the `BEATS_VERSION` variable, such as:

```
make update-beats BEATS_VERSION=7.x
make update-beats BEATS_VERSION=f240148065af94d55c5149e444482b9635801f27
```

### Updating go-elasticsearch

It is important to keep the [go-elasticsearch client](https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch) in sync
with the according major version. We also recommend to use the latest available client for minor versions.

You can use `go get -u -m github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v7@7.x` to update to the latest commit on the
7.x branch.

## Packaging

The beats framework provides tools to cross-compile and package apm-server for different platforms.
This requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [mage](magefile.org), and vendoring as described above.
To build all apm-server packages from source, run:

```
mage package
```

This will fetch and create all images required for the build process.
The whole process can take several minutes.
When complete, packages can be found in `build/distributions/`.

### Building docker packages

To customize image configuration, see [the docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/running-on-docker.html).

To build docker images from source, run:

```
PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 mage -v package
```

When complete, docker images can be found through the local docker daemon and at `build/distributions/apm-server-*-linux-amd64.docker.tar.gz`.

When building images for testing pre-release versions, we recommend setting `SNAPSHOT=true` in the build environment, to
 clearly indicate the packages are not for a specific release.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/index.html) for the APM Server can be found in the `docs` folder.
