            This value is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it ranges
            from 0 to 100%.

              Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux it consists of the free memory
              plus caches and buffers. On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is equal
              to `system.memory.free`.
