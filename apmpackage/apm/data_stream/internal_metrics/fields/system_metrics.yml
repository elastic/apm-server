- name: system.cpu.total.norm.pct
  type: scaled_float
  description: |
    The percentage of CPU time spent by the process since the last event. This value is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it ranges from 0 to 100%.

- name: system.memory.actual.free
  type: long
  description: |
    Actual free memory in bytes. It is calculated based on the OS. On Linux it consists of the free memory plus caches and buffers. On OSX it is a sum of free memory and the inactive memory. On Windows, it is equal to `system.memory.free`.
